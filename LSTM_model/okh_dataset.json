Understanding the importance of internships, Giri applied to a few companies through social media. \n\u201cNone of them responded to me and I was getting frustrated,\u201d says Giri.\nOne day, however, a friend came up to tell her about how she found an internship opportunity through InternSathi and how responsive they were to people\u2019s needs.\n\u201cI used InternSathi and within a couple of days, I found one internship,\u201d says Giri who is working as an intern in the operation management department of an advertising agency.\nIn today\u2019s age, the trend of internships has seen a significant surge among recent graduates and students in their final years of study. For many, an internship is the first step towards a career in their chosen field. Not only does it offer valuable insights into office culture and working mechanisms, but it also provides a host of skills essential for their professional future. However, finding the right internships can be challenging. This is where InternSathi comes in.\nStarted by Kunal Sah in 2022, InternSathi is an internship-focused platform formed to help students get quality internships in Nepal and help them excel at it. Sah\u2019s calling came after realising the challenges faced by many individuals in securing internship opportunities due to a lack of information on where to look.\n\u201cThe primary goal of InternSathi is to assist young boys and girls in finding suitable internship opportunities. I believe we have been of help to young boys and girls,\u201d says Sah.\nGradual growth\nRepresentational image\nInitially, Sah kickstarted the business through social media. Launching a website during the initial phase seemed daunting, as he only started his entrepreneurial journey and lacked confidence. As time progressed, Sah engaged himself in learning various aspects of the business. \nThrough continuous research and active participation in workshops, events, and conferences, he not only expanded his knowledge but also developed connections and built strong public relations with relevant individuals in the field.\n\u201cThat gave me the belief I could start a website too. There are many websites where people can find jobs, but not many where they can look for internships,\u201d he says.\nKunal Sah, founder of InternSathi \nSah says InternSathi work with around 432 companies from various parts of the country. To smoothen user experience, InternSathi has a team of 10 skilled human resources professionals, each handling specific roles. This team, Sah says, is dedicated to simplifying the process, making it effortless for applicants to explore and find suitable internship opportunities through InternSathi.\n\u201cSo far 400 people have found internships,\u201d says Sah.\nNot wanting to exploit young people, Sah says all internships that are found through InternSathi are paid.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear with the companies we work with about how these internships should give at least enough money for them to commute and buy lunch. We don\u2019t want our users being exploited,\u201d he says.\nAccording to Sah, 80 per cent of InternSathi\u2019s user base is actively seeking internship opportunities in the rapidly growing IT sector in Nepal.\nChallenges ahead\nRepresentational image\nWhile a lot of individuals are getting internship opportunities from InternSathi, there are some challenges that the companies have been facing.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to Sah, one major challenge currently faced by InternSathi is the lengthy hiring process by some companies. In instances where the hiring timeline is extended, applicants often lose patience and seek opportunities elsewhere. \nAnother challenge faced by InternSathi is related to quality control. For example, some applicants tend to apply to numerous positions without considering their qualifications and skills. For instance, an applicant trained in only one programming language applies to vacancies that specifically require expertise in multiple programming languages. \n\u201cThis has led to an overflow of CV submissions, creating challenges for both the hiring party and ourselves,\u201d says Sah. \u201cAs underskilled applicants face difficulty in securing placements, some have resorted to complaining about our services, with a few even labelling us as scammers.\u201d\nHowever, Sah says that the company is working to overcome such challenges.\nSustainability model\nRepresentational image. Photo: Pexels/ Sebastian Voortman\nFor any company to thrive, revenue is essential. So, how does InternSathi generate its revenue? \nOnce an applicant submits their CV to the hiring company, the latter can only access basic information such as the applicant\u2019s name and academic qualifications. To unveil contact details like phone number and email address, the company that wants to hire will have to pay InternSathi a fee.\nInternSathi also wants to add a private listing feature where hiring announcements will not be made public; instead, they will be directed exclusively to the targeted audience.\n\u201cFor example, if a hiring company specifically wants to hire candidates from XYZ college, the information will only be communicated to individuals with official email accounts from XYZ college,\u201d says Sah.\nIn light of this, InternSathi is currently establishing partnerships with various colleges as many educational institutions now provide official email accounts to their students.\n ",

    "14": "\nDr Tidiane Kinda, Deputy Division Chief, IMF\nDr Tidiane Kinda is a Deputy Division Chief and Mission Chief to Nepal at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Previously Assistant to the Director, he is an economist with extensive country experience in surveillance, IMF-supported programs, and technical assistance. \nAn IMF staff team, led by Dr Kinda, conducted a staff visit to Kathmandu from February 5 to 12, to discuss recent macroeconomic developments and the implementation of the Fund-supported program. \nIn an interview with Janardan Baral of Onlinekhabar, he shared his views on the current economic situation of Nepal, the IMF-supported reform programme, and clarified misunderstandings and misrepresentations about the idea that the IMF interferes in Nepal\u2019s domestic economic policies. \nExcerpts:\nNepal has been undergoing a period of sluggish economic growth for the past few years, and the medium-term projections from the IMF are not encouraging either. How would you analyse the current economic situation in Nepal?\nThis is a very important question for us, one that we paid attention to during our recent visit to Nepal because of the current relatively slow growth. The IMF\u2019s growth estimation was around one per cent for the last fiscal year. However, this year, we expect to see some recovery. IMF\u2019s projection for this fiscal year is that growth will be around 3.1 per cent.\nThe IMF\u2019s projection is predicated on stronger execution of capital expenditure this year. We hope to see that materializing in the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate an improvement in credit growth, which has been quite subdued in the first half of the year. In terms of the medium-term, even though we expect a recovery from 1 per cent to just 3 per cent this year, our medium-term prospect is positive, aiming to return to about potential growth rate of 5 per cent. This will be the reflection of strategic investment coming into the stream, particularly in the energy sector, helping to boost growth back to around 5 per cent in the coming years.\nNepal is currently grappling with significant economic challenges. Domestic demand is remarkably low, government revenue collection is not as robust as hoped, and expenditures remain below average due to funding shortages. The country appears to be slipping into a cycle of low revenue, low expenditure, and low demand, potentially leading to an economic recession. What are your thoughts on this situation?\nThis is clearly a quite challenging situation, especially regarding the weak performance of revenue collection. However,\u00a0 when we look at the execution of the budget in the first half of this fiscal year, we observe some increase in revenue collection, but not as much as we expected. Nevertheless, there is hope because revenue is starting to grow back. We acknowledge that spending execution is below what we expected, particularly in capital spending, which is crucial for boosting growth. Weak revenue performance could be one of the factors behind slow capital expenditure. However, Nepal has a way to boost capital spending while addressing the low revenue collection. In this situation, Nepal should rely more on donor financing, which is concessional and can help provide financing for capital spending.\u00a0\nSo, even though the current situation is challenging, Nepal could be able to experience both higher capital spending and higher revenue soon. This is why we are working with the government to devise and implement a domestic revenue mobilization strategy that will help boost revenue. Additionally, we are working on a public investment management action plan, which will include concrete actions to address sluggishness in the execution of capital spending. Expectations are that results could start to become visible in these two aspects soon.\nDr Tidiane Kinda\nWhat recommendations would you propose for the economic recovery, particularly in stimulating aggregate domestic demand?\nWe\u2019ve been advising the government that one area that quickly boosts domestic demand is accelerating the execution of capital spending. But, at the same time, we don\u2019t want spending to go to waste. So, it is important to proceed gradually and wisely, targeting the most efficient projects.\u00a0\nWe have been discussing this matter extensively with the government. We believe that going forward, capital spending will increase and that will help to boost domestic demand.\u00a0\nNepal\u2019s banks and financial institutions are grappling with the challenge of low capital adequacy ratios, hindering their capacity for additional lending. Moreover, starting this year, banks are obligated to uphold an additional 0.5 per cent of core capital as a counter-cyclical buffer. What potential solutions do you propose for addressing this issue?\nWhat we observe is that system-wide, Nepal\u2019s banking sector is sound. A few banks seem to have a capital adequacy ratio on the lower side and need recapitalization. The solution to boost growth is not to relax regulations but to focus on why credit is not growing. When we look at the system as a whole, liquidity is ample. So, credit is low not because of a lack of liquidity but because of a demand issue. We believe that boosting demand, in particular investment either domestic or FDI, will genuinely help increase credit growth further. \u2019It is essential to note that having high credit growth is not necessarily a good situation. The best scenario is to have healthy credit growth, aimed at financing good investment projects, and contribute to economic growth and job creation.\nIf we look at the past in Nepal, large increases in credit have not translated into economic growth and job creation. What is important now is to have credit growth that is sustainable and translates into investment and stronger economic growth. We believe that implementing the financial sector reforms envisaged under the IMF Extended Credit Facility, such as working capital loan guidelines and amended asset classification regulations, will help Nepal achieve healthier and more sustainable credit growth, thereby improving economic activity.\n\n\n\nAs you mentioned, Nepal Rastra Bank issued working capital loan guidelines last year as part of its commitment under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) of the International Monetary Fund. However, the private sector expressed dissatisfaction with the guidelines and exerted pressure on the central bank to make amendments. In response to their demands, NRB has revised the guidelines multiple times. How do you analyse these developments in Nepal?\nWe\u2019ve been supporting Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) in terms of implementing these amended asset classification regulations and working capital loan guidelines, which we see as very important. We believe that the continuous implementation of these regulations is crucial to address underlying vulnerabilities and help unleash Nepal\u2019s growth potential. The fact that NRB has had to amend them a couple of times does not mean that the regulations are not effective. Sometimes, there is a need to implement regulations smoothly and gradually to allow the private sector to adjust to the new situation.\nWhat we observe is that the amended asset classification regulations are already bearing fruit. If you look at the composition of credit, you can see that term loans, which are more appropriate funding for investment projects, are increasing, while working capital loans, which aim at smoothing companies\u2019 turnover and are therefore less appropriate to finance investment, are decreasing. This is a healthy transition that we see and want to encourage. Going forward, the NRB needs to keep implementing these regulations, enhancing them, and tightening them as the situation improves.\nSome individuals in Nepal, particularly in the private sector, perceive that the IMF is intervening in the country\u2019s domestic economic policies, particularly in the monetary policy. Could you please clarify how the IMF recommends policy reforms to member countries? Has it genuinely interfered with Nepal\u2019s domestic policy? Kindly elaborate, considering Nepal\u2019s major commitments under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).\nIMF programs are designed to support governments\u2019 economic programs. The government has its own economic reform programs. For instance, in the context of the upcoming investment summit in Nepal, the government is planning to implement several of these reforms before the summit. Many of these reforms are in the same spirit as some of the reforms envisaged under the IMF\u2019s ECF.\u00a0\nWhen designing IMF-supported programs, as a first step, we listen to governments. Governments share with the IMF what are their priorities to improve the economy.\u00a0 With that information, the IMF advise on the way to achieving these priorities, by bringing in the best recommendations based on the IMF experience in other countries. The objective is to set a number of reforms that both sides, IMF and governments, believe are important. The IMF just supports the government in implementing those reforms and policies, through policy advice and technical assistance.\nThis means that the ECF is not \u201cthe program of the IMF\u201d; it belongs to the Nepali authorities, with the IMF playing an advisory role. But of course, as you know, implementing reforms is very difficult. This happens also in many other countries, not only in Nepal. This is why we always support the government. We provide technical assistance to help implement the program. But the program provides, in a way, a commitment device; it helps bring all parties together, and it helps bring a macro situation together. It helps to show why implementing certain reforms is important and how it can hold together. It helps the country be better off tomorrow.\nSo, you do not interfere with government policies?\nWe help the government in implementing its economic policies, but we do not impose anything on the government. We work together with the government. We listen to the government but do not interfere in domestic policies.\nWhat we do is bring in expertise and cross-country experiences, because we have experts going to all countries in the world helping governments to implement their policies and reforms. However, we also take into account that each country is unique. We look at the uniqueness of Nepal and then work together with the government to devise policies and reforms that are appropriate for Nepal.\n\nNepal\u2019s commitments under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), such as amending laws to grant autonomy to Nepal Rastra Bank, conducting external audits of the ten major commercial banks, reviewing asset quality, and ensuring transparency by making government-granted tax exemptions accessible to the public, remain unfulfilled. How do you analyze Nepal\u2019s progress in economic reform?\nActually, I would not say that these commitments are unfulfilled; they are in progress.\u00a0\nFor instance, let\u2019s take the example of the amendment of the NRB Act. This is a long process; it requires discussions with authorities. We can bring in what other countries are doing. However, it is very, very important for us to listen to authorities, and listen to what they are thinking. Some aspects of the amendments to the act proposed by our experts may be complicated for Nepal to implement given its domestic legal framework. Therefore,\u00a0we discuss the proposed amendments and then reach an agreement based on both our experience and the government\u2019s views. \nIn that context for the NRB Act, we agreed jointly to allow more time for discussion to agree on the final set of amendments. Regarding the loan portfolio review, this has not been launched yet. It is in preparation. The launch of the program will take place in a few months from now. In a nutshell, we do see some progress in the reform areas that we agreed on with the government.\nSo, don\u2019t you think that it could have been expedited quickly?\nOf course, at times the faster reforms are implemented the better. But what is important is ownership. So, we also want the government to explain to the Nepali people, why the reforms are important and what the goals are. Sometimes people, or even the business community, don\u2019t fully understand the importance of the reforms. So, the government should take the time to explain it to all stakeholders.\nWe believe that if reform is owned by the people if a government believes in it and owns it and just sees the IMF\u2019s role as supportive, this is the ideal situation to make that reform successful and longer-lasting. The effectiveness of the reform will transcend the duration of the IMF programme. The idea is not to support and implement reforms just because there is an IMF programme while forgetting about them once the program is over. We work really hand in hand with the government, and we believe that\u2019s the way to go.\nNepal currently possesses a strong foreign exchange reserve, adequate to sustain imports of goods and services for over a year. Generally, there is a consensus that countries should maintain reserves equivalent to 100 per cent of short-term debt or approximately 3 to 4 months\u2019 worth of imports. Is such a substantial reserve necessary for Nepal?\nThis is a very important question. In the context of Nepal, it has a fixed exchange rate. So it\u2019s crucial to keep ample reserves. What is also important to remember is that about two years ago, the situation was not the same, which means the situation can sometimes change very quickly. Having a high level of reserves, as you mentioned, is an indicator that Nepal has a very strong economy. It shows that Nepal also has good fundamentals.\nNot only does Nepal have a high level of reserves, but it also has a relatively low level of debt. From a fiscal and external perspective, it really shows that Nepal has good economic fundamentals. It also indicates that if a foreign investor comes to invest in Nepal, there is low risk because there is an exchange rate adjustment when investing.\nSo, it is very important to protect these reserves and use them only when necessary.\nOne last point is that, of course, reserves are growing because of strong remittances, and strong tourism, but also let\u2019s not forget because of subdued import growth. So, when imports recover, that will mean that reserve accumulation will be less, or even reserves will decline. But that will not be a problem because the starting level is very high. So it\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that having high reserves is very, very important to face future shocks.\nHow can these reserves be optimally utilised within the country?\nThe reserves are supposed to be buffers. The way to use the buffers is you keep them in a very safe until the situation emerges that necessitates their use.\nLet me give you an example. In terms of consistency of policies that we are advising. Clearly, aggregate demand is low, we all agree on that. Second, we agree that accelerating capital spending is important to boost aggregate demand and growth. We also agree that this is an area where the government in particular the Ministry of Finance is making an effort to accelerate capital spending and what we hope is that these efforts will start bearing fruit. We expect to see some increase in capital spending in the second half of the year.\u00a0\nWhen we see capital spending increasing, there will be higher imports even this year and this will need to be financed by using the reserves. I believe that\u2019s one optimal way of using it.\u00a0\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\nThe IMF has indicated that the transmission of monetary policy in Nepal is weak, especially in the context of balance sheet repair and inflation control. I believe that controlling inflation through monetary policy is challenging for Nepal, given the pegging of the Nepali Rupee (NPR) with the Indian Rupee (INR). What recommendations would you propose to enhance the effectiveness of Nepal\u2019s monetary policy?\nThis is not the case only in Nepal. Usually, monetary policy transmission in all developing and low-income countries is weak, and there is always room to improve its effectiveness.\u00a0\nNow, a key question that we have been asking ourselves is the transmission of monetary policy to credit growth. Credit growth has been quite subdued, and we understand the frustration that could arise from that. But one thing I would like to emphasise is that liquidity, for instance, in this system, is quite ample and has already started to help in revitalizing credit growth.\u00a0\nThe second aspect is that the monetary policy has been loosened in the last few months. However, it takes time for the transmission to impact deposit rates, but you can see that it has already started to have an impact. Of course, the transmission takes time, and it will be accelerated over time. However, that transmission should lead to less incentive to save and more incentive to invest.\nNot only that, if deposit rates also decline, it will lead to lower lending rates, and again that could lead to more incentive to borrow. It is a relatively long process, but we believe that the actions that the NRB is taking will lead to a slow but steady improvement in monetary policy transmission.\nThe fiscal deficit of the country is excessively high compared to capital expenditure over the last decade. This implies that the government is utilising borrowed funds for recurrent expenditures, including public servants\u2019 salaries, or for debt repayment. How do you analyse the allocative efficiency of the government? Do you believe this practice is sustainable?\u00a0\nBased on our overall assessment, Nepal\u2019s public debt is considered sustainable. We categorise it as having a \u2018low risk of debt distress,\u2019 indicating that we do not foresee any issues regarding the sustainability of public debt in Nepal. If we have to summarise the two strengths of Nepal, one would be a robust external sector with a high level of reserves. The second one would be fiscal sustainability, signifying a low level of debt. However, even though the level of debt is low, it has increased recently, calling for prudence.\nThe current level of debt in Nepal is acceptable, but to prevent further increases, the government should focus on two things. First, how to increase revenue and reduce volatility to avoid the sharp shortfall that we have witnessed in the last couple of years. Therefore, strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation is crucial. In our discussions with the government, we are addressing this issue, and the Finance Ministry has also formed a high-level commission to study it.\u00a0\nSecond, in terms of spending, we must be a bit careful. Even in the execution of the budget this year, we observe low spending. While low spending can be good as it means less debt, it is not necessarily positive, especially if it hampers capital formation. It is important to raise revenue and increase capital spending, leading to growth and even higher revenue.\nWhat would you say about utilising the borrowed money in recurrent expenditure or repayment of the debt?\u00a0\nMany countries in the world rely on domestically borrowed funds as well as external financing to meet their expenditure needs. In the case of Nepal, it has access to quite a large concessional financing, which could be a good way to finance development spending, particularly in infrastructure projects.\nWhen it comes to using debt to finance recurrent spending, some countries try to avoid that and use debt only for capital spending. If a country\u2019s debt level is high and it is in a weak fiscal position, it is advisable to avoid using debt for recurrent spending, unless that recurrent spending is aimed at addressing severe social problems. However, in the case of Nepal, the overall debt level is not excessively high; and importantly, about half of it is highly concessional. But ensuring that more spending goes towards capital formation and building an effective social protection framework is important. If that happens, it will result in higher growth and higher revenue, leading to a higher chance of growing while maintaining the level of debt under control.\nHowever, if countries spend more on recurrent spending than on investment and well-targeted social protection, it could lead to lower growth and the need to keep borrowing more and more debt, implying a higher level of debt, which is problematic. In a nutshell, where the money goes is very important. The government is trying to rationalize spending duplication between the central and local governments, which is welcome. It is good to pay particular attention to that because decentralization is an important process, but it is equally important to ensure that it doesn\u2019t lead to duplication in spending.\nDo you have any messages for the Nepalis?\nWe are truly here to assist the government and Nepali authorities. Our main objective is simple: the betterment of Nepal\u2019s economy for the Nepali people. We listen to the government and stakeholders, provide advice, and do our best to genuinely help the people. We are always delighted to see the success of Nepal. Undoubtedly, Nepal is a country with great potential. However, it is important to accelerate the pace of reforms to fully benefit from the potential that Nepal possesses. We see the upcoming investment summit as a great opportunity to showcase to the world the potential of Nepal and the reforms it needs.\n ",

    "18": "\n\nThe National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country\u2019s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.\nThings were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.\n\u201cI understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,\u201d says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. \u201cConsidering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?\u201d\nA loser\u2019s second chance \nNarayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.\nBhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.\nSimilarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.\nEven those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.\nDespite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).\nSpeaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. \n\u201cThe allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,\u201d he says.\nThe 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.\nEasy way in\nFile: A National Assembly meeting\nThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them.\u00a0\nIn National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. \nMoreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.\nThe National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.\nThe cascading impacts\nFile: A National Assembly meeting\nAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.\nThe latest example \u2013 is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.\nThe UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.\nSpeaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.\nReinstating power\nThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.\nIn December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.\nOn May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.\nThe Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.\nAccording to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.\nBimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. \n\u201cSince the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,\u201d she says.\nConstitutional and legal distinctions\n\nExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.\nIn the preamble of the constitution prepared by the \u2018Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee\u2019 during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.\nChair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country\u2019s expectations with clear criteria.\u00a0\nThere is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, \u201c\u2026It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.\u201d\nAccording to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly \u2013 \u201cThis House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.\u201d\nIn addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.\nThis has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, \u201cSuch an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.\u201d\nNeed for course correction\u00a0\nPM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.\nSome instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions.\u00a0\nOn July 5, 2023,\u00a0 a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.\nDuring the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister\u2019s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.\nTimilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident \u2018a joke\u2019 in the Parliament of Nepal. \n\u201cThis is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.\u201d\u00a0\nTimilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.\nTimilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on \u2018Japan: Past, Present, and Future\u2019 held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.\nPointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, \u201cIn a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?\u201d\nIn August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.\nThis created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party\u2019s interest.\u00a0\nA study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.\nThe report\u2019s concluding remarks say, \u201c\u2026the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that \u2013 \u201cFurthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.\u201d\nOverall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly\u2019s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.\u201d\n ",
    "19": "\nThis map shows seven provinces of Nepal\nThe provincial government was introduced under the provincial system with the hope that the provinces would be powerful; the state authority would be properly utilised and the development would be competitive amongst the provinces before being developed as a whole nation. \nThe number of provinces was discussed many times and finally, all the parties agreed on seven provinces. So, how did the seven provinces contribute to development as expected?\u00a0Did the province boost both its internal revenue and national economic growth? \u00a0\nA well-thought-out discourse is required on the issue.\nDemocratic republic system\nThe first map of the seven provinces. \nThe democratic republic system was established in Nepal on the foundation of Maoist insurgency as civil war and people\u2019s movement. While many countries adopt a democratic system, not all of them have a federal system of government.\nThe federal system of government is a new experience for Nepal.\u00a0After 2017, the governments at all levels have completed five years. It is essential to take stock of these achievements and challenges in the implementation of the federal governance system and this is the right time.\nSections 197 to 202 of Part 15 of the Constitution of Nepal have provided provisions regarding the provincial government management procedure. The arrangement of the Provincial Assembly is as mentioned in the provisions of the Provincial Executive in Part 13 of the Constitution of Nepal, Provincial Legislature in Part 14, Provincial Management Procedures in Part 15 and Economic Procedures in Part 16.\nThe main function of the provincial assembly is to form the government, make provincial laws, monitor the activities of the provincial government and discuss provincial public affairs issues in the provincial assembly. \nStructurally, achievements have certainly been seen at the provincial level. The provincial assembly is formed under the legislature and the executive. Ministries, directorates, commissions and offices have been established, while the departments, institutions, committees and boards under the union have been transferred to the provinces.\nSimilarly, the Public Service Commission has also been formed in the province. After surveying the organisation and management, the administrative structure was created and the employees were adjusted in the province. All provinces have also designated permanent capitals. In the same way, service delivery structures within the province have also been developed at the provincial level.\nIt is said that the federal government system has been strengthened by promoting coordination, collaboration and cooperation between the three levels of government. It does not seem that the coordination is vertical and the third relationship is strengthened. Although those levels accept cooperation, coexistence and coordination, it is not seen practically.\nDifferent forms of problems have emerged in terms of policy and practice in the province. The main task of the provincial assembly is to make mandatory provincial laws for running the provincial government.\u00a0 Until now, more than 240 laws have been made by all provinces.\nProvincial assembly members themselves are saying in various forums that the law has been made to run the government, but the policy has not been made to match the needs of the people.\nInter-level consultation was not made mandatory in lawmaking.\u00a0Due to the lack of legal uniformity between the federal, provincial and local levels, the implementation of the program has become complicated.\u00a0\nIt is necessary to confirm the necessity and propriety of the law.\u00a0Now that the main laws have been made, the rest of the work of the provincial assembly is to amend and review conflicting laws.\nThe operational challenge \n\nNo matter what kind of government system is formed, it will ultimately serve the people. Good governance is to fully utilise the money in the country\u2019s treasury and spend it on the overall development of the country.\u00a0 \nHow the money is collected, how the plans are selected, how the plans are implemented and how the people get their benefit is the main issue.\u00a0 \nThe provincial government\u2019s social and physical infrastructure plans, encompassing areas such as drinking water, building construction, road, and bridge construction, are subjects of general interest. The selection and implementation of these plans involve citizen participation, reflecting principles of good governance.\nThese projects are then implemented in settlements at the local level.\u00a0The market question is, how and which methodology do the provincial ministries use to select the said project?\nQuality maintenance and evaluation processes for activities in the provinces require coordination and cooperation with the local level. Currently, a significant challenge is observed when inquiring about the province\u2019s plan at the local level, as local governments often lack awareness of the plan. This lack of coordination poses a crucial challenge in the effective implementation and evaluation of activities across different administrative levels.\nGood governance has become the most serious issue in all three levels of government in a democratic republic.\u00a0\nAccording to the demand of the citizens, the provincial government has to bear the necessary expenses for development and service delivery from the income, but the imbalance between functional responsibilities and financial resources is visible.\u00a0\nThere is a complaint at the local level that the province makes unnecessary conditions when transferring financial resources. Likewise, the relationship between the province and the local level is not cordial in the distribution of financial resources.\u00a0 \nEven though there is an Inter-Governmental Finance Management Commission, which was formed for consultation on inter-governmental management including the financial partnership of the federal, provincial and local levels, it has not been effective.\u00a0\nTherefore, so far, it has been observed that the province expects maximum financial resources from the union and does not take any initiative to increase the internal income.\u00a0Provincial and local levels are also trying to be autonomous, but due to excessive dependence on financial resources, these two levels are currently unable to be independent.\nThe need for cooperation, coexistence and coordination \nPhoto: Pexels/ Mohan Nannapaneni\nCitizens had many expectations from the provincial government. Now, expectations have converted into complaints that the provincial government is formed as a training centre for employees.\u00a0There are more charges such as investing in unproductive areas, having a centralised mentality, mentally considering the lower government to be of lower status as a lower government, and being indifferent to strengthening the local government, etc.\u00a0 \nSimilarly, there are allegations that there is a weakness in the management of the provincial government. It has not been able to improve its operations and it has not paid attention to development. Likewise, it has been confused in choosing small schemes, and it has been accused of choosing the wrong plan due to the influence of party bias.\nThe inability of the provincial government to generate internal revenue, inability to choose quality projects, duplicity in projects, lack of interest in resource management in security conditions, weak financial discipline, mobilisation of resources only in the infrastructure sector, lack of analysis of sustainability, increasing activities under conditional grants, management of small projects.\nProblems such as being difficult to do, not being able to manage income tax, proposing a full budget when the government transfers finances to the local level, and not being able to make the budget formulation process participative, transparent and result-oriented are seen as urgent problems. \nThe annual budget expenditure rate is also about 50 per cent on an average of all seven provinces and the lowest position among the three layers of government.\nEven now, the political parties in the provincial government are only trying to gain power and an edge rather than strengthen the federal system. The most important thing is the selection of the project to the high demand of people to be conducted by the provincial government and the connection of the people in the implementation, monitoring, and benefit distribution.\nIf the provincial government is not able to prioritise based on the demand and recommend the local government, there will be no justification for the provincial government. Likewise, the subject of cooperation, coexistence and coordination as provided by the constitution is vital. \nPolitically, any problems should be solved first. The capacity of the state level is not as satisfactory as expected. There is still a delay in law-making, employees have been kept under contract, and it seems that most of the employees are transferred within a short period. \nAt least one employee can be institutionalised only if he stays in one station for two years. Due to the new federal civil law, the laws made by the states have not been fully implemented. Because of that, for the stability of the provincial government, it is necessary to reduce the number of ministries, create a public-oriented transparent budget, prioritise projects, and put special emphasis on monitoring and evaluation.\u00a0 \nThe province should work within the scope of work as prescribed by the criteria for the classification and distribution of development programmes and projects at the Province and local levels as guided by the constitution. \nGovernment employees also should pay attention to the psychology that the provincial government will remain in existence. Ultimately, doubt on sustainability will be expressed about the provincial assembly\u2019s rationality if its members are unable to settle the conflict with federal law and demonstrate involvement beyond establishing a government and amending the remaining legislation rather than hanging around the ministries for tiny projects.\n ",

On Thursday, a business negotiation took place between the two parties in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, aimed at setting the rate for the sale of 40 megawatts of electricity.\nPradeep Kumar Thike, deputy managing director at the NEA, told Onlinekhabar that although there were positive talks between Nepal and Bangladesh, an agreement on the rate could not be reached.\nThe Bangladesh board had issued a call for competitive tenders for the purchase of electricity from Nepal. However, as the electricity export permit from Nepal is exclusively granted to the NEA, only its proposal was presented.\nThe Authority had offered to export electricity to Bangladesh at around 7 cents per unit. However, Bangladesh proposed a reduction in that rate. \n\u201cWe communicated that the rate quoted by us was \u2018non-negotiable,\u2019 but they needed to take it into consideration,\u201d said Thike.\nThike said the Authority told Bangladesh it was not willing to export electricity at a lower rate than what it is currently exporting to India. Recently, an agreement was reached with India to export 200 megawatts of electricity at INR 5.25 per unit (Rs 8.50).\n\u201cWe have communicated our point of view well. They have taken it positively,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the Authority, the electricity generated from the 23 MW Trishuli and 19 MW Lower Modi hydropower projects will be sold to Bangladesh.\nPreviously, Bangladesh had decided to import 40 MW of electricity from Nepal. On December 6, 2023, the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of Ministers, led by Bangladesh Finance Minister Mustafa Kamal, approved the proposal from the Bangladesh Power Development Board to import 40 megawatts of electricity.\nThike also mentioned that Bangladeshi representatives have assured the Authority to make a decision on the rate and establish a bilateral agreement within the next few weeks.\n\u201cOther aspects of the agreement between Nepal and Bangladesh have already been settled. The draft has been exchanged accordingly, and an agreement will be formalised as soon as the issue of rates is resolved,\u201d Thike said.\n ",

    "22": "\n\nIf you have ever spoken to those involved in Nepal\u2019s share market, you might have heard the term Demat account. But what is it and how do you get one?\nWell for starters, a Demat account is an electronic account that holds securities such as shares, bonds, and other financial instruments in a dematerialised or electronic form. In Nepal, Demat mainly holds stocks, debentures and mutual fund units.\nSince its inception in 2014, the Demat account has replaced physical share certificates, enabling investors and traders to conduct electronic transactions for buying, selling, and transferring shares. Now people can set up an account at a Depository Participant. This, over the long run, has benefited the Nepal Stock Exchange over the long term.\nChoose a Depository Participant (DP)\nNepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), Nepal\u2019s only stock market\nA Depository Participant is a financial institution that acts as an intermediary between the investor and the central depository. The Central Depository System and Clearing Ltd. (CDSC) is the central depository in Nepal. It operates as a subsidiary of Nepal Stock Exchange Ltd (NEPSE) and functions as per the securities regulations stipulated by the Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON).\nYou need to select a DP that is registered with the CDSC. There are 111 licensed DPs, you can choose any one of them and open an account.\nHow to open a Demat account\nFirstly, you will need to fill out the account opening form. Complete the form, including the Know Your Customer (KYC) form and agreement with the DP or the bank that outlines the terms and conditions of the DMAT account. Make sure to provide accurate information and double-check all details before submission. Other documents you would require include:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Proof of identity (e.g., citizenship certificate, passport, driving license or any government-issued ID)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Proof of address (e.g., utility bill, bank statement)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Passport-sized photographs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 PAN card (Permanent Account Number)\n[Note: Specific requirements and procedures may vary slightly depending on the DP you choose.]\nAfter verifying your documents and information, you will receive your DMAT account details, including your unique Beneficiary Owner Identification (BOID) number.\u00a0\nPhoto by Nimisha Mekala on Unsplash\nFAQs about the Demat account\nHow are transactions conducted in a Demat account?\nTransactions involve the buying and selling of securities through a stockbroker. When you buy securities, they are credited to your Demat account, and when you sell, they are debited.\nHow is a Demat account different from a trading account?\nWhile a Demat account holds securities in electronic form, a trading account is used for buying and selling securities in the stock market. Investors typically have both a Demat account and a trading account for a complete trading and investment experience.\nCan I have multiple Demat accounts?\nYes, an individual can have multiple Demat accounts, but each account must be with a different DP. In Nepal, you can have two different Demat accounts. However, having multiple accounts is not necessary for most investors. It is also not recommended to use different Demat accounts to buy or sell the same stocks/ IPOs in the stock market.\nWhat is a BOID number?\nBOID is a unique 16-digit identification number given to you when you open the Demat account, as described above. The first eight numbers represent your DP and the latter eight numbers represent your Client ID with the DP. In all transactions, one must mention their BOID number.\nHow much does it cost to open a Demat account?\nOpening a Demat account requires charges such as account opening fees, annual maintenance charges, and transaction fees. However, the specific charges may vary among different Depository Participants.\n ",

    "30": "\n\nWhen Simantraj Thakuri went to a grocery store in Kirtipur to buy rice, he was asked an odd question: \u201cIndian or Nepali rice?\u201d Thakuri opted for Indian rice as it was cheaper. However, the shopkeeper gave him a rice sack with Nepali branding.\nConfused, he asked the shopkeeper, \u201cWhy does the Indian rice sack have Nepali branding?\u201d\nThe shopkeeper explained to Thakuri how importing Indian rice had become increasingly difficult, leading them to repackage the rice and sell it within the country.\nThis conversation sheds light on the current situation in the rice market in Nepal. What has not helped is the Indian government\u2019s ban on the export of non-basmati rice. Despite this restriction, Indian rice remains readily available in the market.\n\u201cIt is India who has banned the export of rice, but Nepal has not banned its import,\u201d the shopkeeper told Thakuri. \nHe further told Thakuri how a sack, usually 25 kilograms, was Rs 500 cheaper than Nepali rice and that it tasted better too.\nIndian rice smuggled to Nepal\nPhoto by Sandy Ravaloniaina on Unsplash\nThe practice of repackaging Indian rice is predominantly observed in Kathmandu valley. In the plains of the Terai, one can easily obtain Indian rice without it being repackaged.\nData from the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies indicates that since July 2023, Indian rice, apart from basmati, has not officially entered the country. However, Indian rice continues to dominate the Nepali market.\nThe Ministry says this is due to the open border between Nepal and India coupled with a high demand for rice in the country.\n\u201cRice produced in the country cannot meet the demand. The Indian government has set a quota for rice but that is not going to be enough which is why thousands of kilograms of rice are being smuggled into the country,\u201d says an official of the Minister on the condition of anonymity. \nNepali industries in trouble\n\nIndia has adopted a strict approach aimed at reducing rice exports to Nepal. This includes a strategy of exporting only the final product rather than the raw material. Additionally, anticipating a decrease in rice production, India has imposed a 20 per cent export customs tax on rice.\nThis has directly affected the Nepali rice industry. \nKrishna Lal Dugar, the owner of KL Dugar Group, expresses that it has become challenging for Nepali industries to operate effectively due to this.\n\u201cWe have repeatedly urged the government to simplify the process of rice importation,\u201d Dugar said. \u201cHowever, it is becoming increasingly challenging to produce rice by importing expensive paddy from India.\u201d\nAccording to Dugar, the price of rice imported from India only increases due to a 20 per cent tax, while the Nepali import tax is approximately two per cent.\n\u201cWhen an industrialist purchases rice from India through the legal channel and produces Nepali branded rice, the prices increase. However, there is rampant smuggling of both paddy and rice across the open border. This is breaking our back,\u201d he said.\nDugar highlighted that there is a significant difference between the price of rice officially purchased and the price of smuggled rice.\n\u201cWe have urged the government to tighten border control if it cannot eliminate the export tax imposed by India. If our domestic rice production cannot adequately supply the market, the government should take measures to regulate the rice market,\u201d Dugar said.\nHe said that there is no alternative to importing rice due to the significant disparity between the reported rice production data by the government of Nepal and the practical reality.\n\u201cEven though the official data indicates high rice production, it does not align with practical conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cPaddy and rice will continue to enter Nepal through various means. Therefore, the government should focus on establishing official channels for the benefit of all stakeholders.\u201d\nThe tax on rice\nRice: The staple food of Nepal\nSince July 20, 2023, India has imposed a complete ban on non-basmati rice. Following the ban on rice exports aimed at bolstering its own food security, Nepal has sought to import rice from India through a quota system.\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supply, Nepal had requested 100,000 tons of rice from the Indian government. India said that it was only willing to send 95,000 tons of rice on the condition that it should be taken from a cooperative run by the Indian government and with a 20 per cent customs tax. Meanwhile, Nepal has already imposed a 12 per cent tax on imported rice.\n\u201cWe have brought the rice from India as India subjected a 32 per cent tax on it. This made the rice very expensive compared to Nepali rice. Additionally, India has stipulated certain conditions for the quota, which is why we have not availed it,\u201d said Gajendra Kumar Thakur, ministry spokesperson.\nAccording to the data provided by the Ministry, Nepal requires 4.8 million tons of rice annually. Of this, 3 million tons are needed for cooking plain rice, while the remaining rice is used for making chiura (beaten rice), rice flour, and other purposes flour.\n\u201cTalking about paddy, 7 million tons of paddy is needed, of which our production is only 5.4 million. Everything else has to be imported,\u201d said Thakur.\nThe production and consumption of rice\nMore a majority of Nepalis, rice is a staple diet.\nAccording to the data of the customs department for 11 months before India banned the export, an average of Rs 13.5 million worth of paddy and rice was being imported daily.\nIn the 11 months before July 2023, Nepal has imported paddy and rice worth Rs 45.29 billion. According to the data of the Customs Department, rice worth Rs 28.5 billion and paddy worth Rs 15.92 billion have entered Nepal.\nAccording to Thakur, if the government promoted paddy plantation twice a year, it could solve the crisis. \n\u201cBig industries should focus on commercial rice cultivation as there is no alternative to increase domestic rice production,\u201d said Thakur.\nThe public agricultural census data in September 2023 found that in the last 30 years, the human resources involved in rice cultivation have increased, but there is no significant progress in rice production.\nThe number of farmers involved in rice cultivation has progressively increased over the years, with 2.37 million in 1991, 2.466 million in 2001, 2.669 million in 2011, and currently standing at 2.765 million.\nHowever, 30 years ago, rice cultivation spanned 1.487 million hectares, which decreased by 265,000 hectares to reach the year 2023.\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, in the current fiscal year 2023/24, the government has allocated Rs 58.95 billion for agricultural development. Of this, only Rs 30 billion is allocated for the purchase of chemical fertilisers.\nAccording to the ministry, 90 per cent of the remaining Rs 28.95 billion can be spent on current expenditure. Officials of the ministry said that despite getting the highest budget in agriculture so far, this amount of budget cannot do any significant work.\n ",

    "33": "\nImage for representation only: Remittance inflow\nAccording to Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), remittance inflows have\u00a0increased by 25 per cent\u00a0in the latest fiscal year,\u00a0reaching over USD 10 billion. In 2022, overseas transfers were about $7 billion. This fast-growing remittance from migrant workers now accounts for almost a quarter percentage of Nepal\u2019s\u00a0USD 46 billion nominal GDP as of 2023.\nThe rise in remittance is playing a crucial role in stabilising Nepal\u2019s external accounts, foreign exchange reserves, and financing imports; however, it is also causing a continuous deterioration of the trade balance due\u00a0to an increased demand for imported consumable goods. As remittances go up, the trade deficits also increase in the same proportion. The primary concern is that\u00a0the hard-earned remittance money is not being used for development and other productive sectors of the economy that create jobs\u00a0and reduce dependence on imports.\nRemittances (as a source of income and foreign exchange) are not sustainable in the long run. We must realise that over-reliance on consumption without making productive investments will cause Nepal to miss out on opportunities for industrial growth, as seen in other countries that strategically use diaspora funds. The government must devise and implement targeted policies to capitalise on migrant savings so that remittance money can help drive the country\u2019s enterprise and technology revolution.\nPresent usage and economic impacts\nPhoto: Unsplash/ Visual Stories || Micheile\nCurrently,\u00a0more than 90 per cent of remittance spending in Nepal goes towards importing food, clothing, and electronics with little value addition to the larger economy. This type of spending certainly does help families in the short run; however, in the long run, it does not contribute much to economic development. Instead, investing a good portion of the remittance money in other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, or services could potentially transform the country\u2019s macroeconomics.\nFurthermore, the large remittances have caused Nepal\u2019s currency to be significantly overvalued compared to India\u2019s currency and\u00a0hurt Nepal\u2019s export competitiveness. The growing trade deficits have led to a drain of incoming dollars as the country struggles to keep up with the import surge fueled by migrant incomes.\nLikewise, when the remittance money is continuously utilised only for consumption rather than investment, it creates a cycle of dependencies. It also incentivises young people to leave Nepal for work instead of pursuing education or other entrepreneurial ventures. As we have observed in Nepal for over a decade, this leads to a brain drain and a shortage of skilled labour in the labour market.\u00a0\nTherefore, it is crucial to use remittances for production rather than just household consumption to sustain growth and avoid external crises in the long term.\nSuccess stories from other countries\u00a0\nRepresentative graphic.\nMany developing countries have boosted their industrial growth by using diaspora bonds to fund infrastructure projects. Mexico\u2019s famous 3\u00d71 program is a successful initiative that has helped to develop grassroots communities.\u00a0The program matches each dollar of collective hometown remittance investments into community projects with three government dollars. This has resulted in the funding of thousands of health clinics, schools, roads, and micro-enterprises across various Mexican states. The collaboration between organized diasporas and local administration was critical in enabling the success of this program.\nIn India, highways, power plants, and ports have been built using such capital tools, which have improved connectivity and increased private sector productivity. Similarly, telecom, aviation, pharma, and IT giants in emerging Asian economies have also been funded from non-resident community savings.\u00a0The Philippines has utilized remittances in a variety of ways, such as expanding rural electricity access, which has led to job creation and growth in manufacturing in previously underdeveloped areas. Bangladesh\u2019s government also launched\u00a0many valuable projects\u00a0to improve workers\u2019 skills and channel remittance money to improve economic sustainability.\nPolicy ideas for Nepal\u00a0\nSeveral policy ideas can help make productive use of remittance money. The first step is introducing NRN savings bonds and dedicated equity funds to mobilise diaspora money into various sectors such as tourism, handicrafts, IT, manufacturing and farming ventures. \nIn this regard, easing foreign exchange controls and allowing dollar accounts could provide further incentives for investments beyond the consumption spending of remittances. The government should also encourage remittances through proper channels and discourage informal hundis. Nepal can learn from Bangladesh,\u00a0which incentivises expatriates to send remittances through legal channels by offering a five per cent reward.\u00a0\u00a0\nSecondly, the government should promote matching grant partnerships through local agencies. In this scenario, village cooperatives would receive two/three times more funding than collective remittance schemes for growth-centric projects such as eco-tourism, tea or ginger farming, and micro-hydropower, among others. This scheme can create an emotional bond between the diaspora and native communities, aiding in their upliftment.\nThirdly, aligning skills development and vocational training programs with overseas job market needs and providing entrepreneurship possibilities can significantly increase employability, family incomes, and remittances. This, in turn, can help more households achieve financial stability.\nIt is essential to have transparent, efficient, and accountable institutions and governance to ensure a steady flow of remittances. The Nepal government could potentially collaborate with Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu University, and NRN to share knowledge and research outcomes. Such an alliance could help develop an appropriate program focused on the best utilization of remittance money.\u00a0\nLooking ahead\nMigration will continue to play a crucial role in Nepal\u2019s national growth story for the next couple of decades. However, it is vital to have strategic policies that effectively utilise remittances for investment purposes. To achieve sustainable growth, Nepal should invest remittance money in the next generation of exporters, businesses, and agricultural ventures instead of using it for current consumption.\u00a0\nAs the Nepali overseas community grows each year, it is necessary to adopt a diaspora-powered framework that facilitates contributions through institutional reforms. By seizing global opportunities and using income to promote national progress, Nepal\u2019s landscape can be transformed significantly in just a few years. The Nepal government, political leaders, and NRN leadership, regardless of political party affiliation, need to rise above populist isolationism and create a supportive environment that encourages productivity both at home and abroad.\u00a0\nNepalis have demonstrated their ability to build successful lives overseas, and now it is time to use policy innovation to direct our largest financial influx toward powering Nepal\u2019s development transformation.\n ",

What started with the aim of bringing the Silicon Valley culture to Nepal, can be seen as a success as the company has now expanded its services to three other countries and has set up offices in five different locations. \n\u201cWe believe in providing a complete solution, from concept to execution,\u201d says Kailash Bijayananda, Senior Vice President of the company who has been there from the company\u2019s early years. \u201cWe offer a range of services, including software application development, cloud management, QA, design, Cloud services, DevOps, Data and AI.\u201d\nLeapfrog\u2019s focus from the start has been providing services focusing on custom software development. While its roots lie in serving startups, Leapfrog has expanded its reach to cater to enterprises, notably in the healthcare sector.\n\u201cWe give a complete one-stop solution. Clients want everything covered from mobile and web app development to AI integration, database management, and data analytics and we offer all that,\u201d\u00a0says Bijayananda.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to merely claim to offer these services and then engage two or three vendors to fulfil the remaining needs. The concept of a one-stop solution empowers individuals to evolve into a fully equipped and proficient team,\u201d he adds.\nThrough these efforts, Leapfrog has successfully cultivated a professional tech culture in Nepal. Aligned with the vision set forth by founders Himal Karmacharya, Chandika Bhandari and current CEO Chris Sprague, the company is committed to advancing further and establishing itself as the top tech company in the country.\nWork Culture\nPerformance during the Rock Night, an event organised by Leapfrog Photo: Leapfrog \nBesides its services, what sets Leapfrog apart is its work culture.\nTraditional companies in Nepal usually look at the number of hours a person spends at the office and the quantity of work completed. However, at Leapfrog, there is a different perspective. The company recognises that mere presence at a desk does not necessarily correlate to productivity.\n\u201cMost of what we do here involves intense brain work. You can\u2019t just say \u2018work\u2019 and expect a solution, especially in the tech field,\u201d says Bijayananda.\u00a0 \u201cSometimes, people feel motivated and can work for 12 hours straight. But other times, solving just one problem can take up to four hours.\u201d\u00a0\nThat is why at Leapfrog they offer team members a lot of flexibility. You can see many employees at the company playing table tennis or other activities to loosen up during office hours.\n\u201cThis helps clear the mind and boost the creativity of our developers,\u201d says Bijayananda.\nYaju Pradhan, currently a Director of Business Development, began her journey with Leapfrog as a QA Intern in the company\u2019s early days. She says Leapfrog has stayed true to its vision of establishing unique innovators led by Nepali engineers and designers.\n\u201cLearning has always been a core value at Leapfrog. The company believes how important learning and growth are for the success of the company,\u201d she says. \u201cTherefore, the company prioritises providing ample opportunities for creativity and learning to flourish within its culture.\u201d\nThe majority of individuals who join the company are fresh college graduates. Pradhan highlights that these young men and women are then offered a flexible and supportive environment which helps them grow.\n\u201cWe believe that by doing this, we can encourage innovation and help our team members reach their full potential,\u201d\u00a0says Pradhan. \u201cWe believe in working as a team and that helps us find new ways to make our products and services better.\u201d\nBecoming part of Leapfrog\nL-R- Kailash Bijayananda and Yaju Pradhan \nIn terms of numbers, Leapfrog primarily hires individuals with backgrounds in computer science. While the majority come from fields such as BSC IT, BCA, and BIT, computer science graduates in general have been the major workforce. However, having a formal degree in computer science is not a strict requirement for joining the company.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t specify formal degrees in our job postings. Self-taught coders who have passed SEE are eligible to join Leapfrog,\u201d says Bijayananda. \u201cWe prioritise coding skills, communication abilities, managerial skills, and interpersonal skills.\u201d\u00a0\nBijayananda further adds the company is more interested in what individuals can do rather than what they cannot. \n\u201cThis is why we look at an individual\u2019s communication and interpersonal and not just their educational background during interviews,\u201d says Bijayananda.\nWhile there is a dedicated recruitment team in place, a significant portion of individuals hired by Leapfrog are those who have previously served as interns within the company.\nThe company recently concluded its 45th internship batch. Typically, it selects around 30 interns out of a pool of over 2,500 applications received each time for the eight-week internship program. These prospective interns then undergo a rigorous selection process, which includes a written test and interview, to secure a position within the company.\n\u201cIn our case, we take special care during recruitment. We don\u2019t rush decisions and provide feedback. In some cases, we have to let interns go due to performance reasons,\u201d says Bijayananda.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, we are cautious from the start, considering the huge investment involved.\u201d\nOut of the 30 interns, Leapfrog hired 7 associate software engineers. In addition to internships, lateral hiring also takes place in Leapfrog. \n\u201cThe majority of hires, however, come from the internship program,\u201d says Bijayananda.\nLeapfrog\u2019s structured internship curriculum focuses on providing practical knowledge, refining coding skills, and enhancing problem-solving approaches, preparing interns for future endeavours.\nPradhan says while software engineering remains the core focus, the company also offer internships and opportunities in other domains.\u00a0\n\u201cCurrently, we have DevOps internships, and we\u2019ve previously conducted design-based internships and project management programs,\u201d she says.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing internships, training, and boot camps across various areas.\u201d\nChallenges\nPhoto: Leapfrog \nGrowing as a company comes with its share of challenges. When the company had fewer staff and everyone was familiar with each other, operations ran more smoothly. However, as the company grew, maintaining proper policies and procedures became more complex.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve remained focused on this in recent years. We want newcomers to feel at home, even as we scale up. With more people, it\u2019s harder to connect with everyone,\u201d says Pradhan.\nHowever, as the company grew, the operation became a challenge along with maintaining a a core learning environment. Pradhan says they even had to build a network of support and ensure there was a balance between structure and space for individual growth.\u00a0\nManaging a larger team also posed difficulties for the management. Bijayananda says how hard it was for the company to handle the influx of staff.\n\u201cInitially, managing around 100 people wasn\u2019t too hard. But as we grew, we realised there was an imbalance,\u201d he says. \u201cWith time, we have handled it better now.\u201d\nLike many IT companies in Nepal, Leapfrog has also faced issues with the brain drain. There is no data on the number of computer science graduates leaving the country but the number is quite high. This, for Leapfrog, is a problem.\n\u201cNot everyone with a computer science degree can code. That makes it harder for us to look for capable individuals who can work in a team with us,\u201d says Bijayananda. \u201cGetting fresh graduates isn\u2019t too hard, but finding experienced seniors in the same field with 5 or 10 years experience is difficult. Many of them are already settled abroad.\u201d\nSmarter generation\nThe Global Team of Leapfrog at the annual company outing 2023. Photo: Leapfrog\nBijayananda, who has been working in the IT sector since 2006, has observed significant changes in fresh graduates over the years. He says the new generation is better and that is mostly thanks to what they learn during their bachelor\u2019s and the access to information thanks to the internet.\nHe also feels there is a growing competition among students, and their eagerness to learn independently has led to notable transformations. Recognising the need to engage with students early on, Leapfrog has introduced the Student Partnership Program. This initiative aims to give students a taste of real-world company operations and prepare them in advance.\nThrough the LeapFrog Student Partnership Program (LSPP), 20 colleges are paired with 20 brand ambassadors. These ambassadors serve as intermediaries between Leapfrog and the student community, sharing information about events, training, and updates. \nBy participating in events such as hackathons, sponsoring programs, and participating in talk shows, Leapfrog offers students exposure to the corporate world. This initiative aids students in gaining insights into the industry while allowing LeapFrog to identify talented individuals at an early stage.\nSunny Mahat, senior manager of marketing communications at Leapfrog Technology, highlights the company\u2019s efforts to extend such initiatives to the school level. \n\u201cBy introducing coding concepts at the primary school level, students gain early exposure to how systems work and understand potential career opportunities,\u201d says Mahat.\nHe says the company is also aiming to introduce coding early through tools like Scratch from MIT, which enables visual learning. \n\u201cWhile not all students may pursue careers in coding, early exposure helps them with valuable knowledge applicable to various professions,\u201d he says.\nWomen in tech\nTihar Celebration at Leapfrog. Photo: Leapfrog\nEven though the IT sector is dominated by men, the number of women in tech is rising. Leapfrog\u2019s workforce currently comprises 25 per cent women, and with the implementation of women-friendly policies, the company is committed to further expanding this number in the years ahead.\n\u201cWe believe policies like menstruation leave and improving maternity benefits will help us become more attractive towards women in tech. These steps aim to reduce the workload and provide flexibility, particularly for new mothers transitioning back to work,\u201d says Pradhan.\nFurthermore, for this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, Leapfrog is planning to organise a program involving community members. The company\u2019s objective is to introduce coding and facilitate discussions on career opportunities, with active involvement from women employees.\nPradhan says that Leapfrog has partnered with the Women Fellowship to launch initiatives such as the \u201cFor Women By Women\u201d internship, which concentrates on software engineering and design.\n\u201cWe plan on continuing these in the future to carve out dedicated spaces for women in the tech sector,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to incorporate women trainers and professionals into its work culture, extending beyond internships.\u201d\n ",

Singh Rural Municipality of Doti has been wandering in the emergency room (red zone) of the Bir Hospital for two days hoping to get an ICU bed for his wife.\nBalayar took his wife, Chanda Devi, to the hospital on February 14 due to a high fever and lethargy. According to him, the doctor did not diagnose the disease until February 16. The doctor informed them that the test report would only be available after four days.\nBalayar does not have the funds to take his wife to a private hospital, and Bir Hospital, a more affordable option, has no available beds. He said waited for days for an ICU bed to be available.\nEvery time he asked, he was told there were none. With every no, a chill went down his spine fearing his wife would die.\n\u201cI heard two patients died because they did not get an ICU bed,\u201d he said, visibly distraught.\nTwo more patients were in the ICU in the emergency room of Bir Hospital. Meanwhile, outside the hospital\u2019s emergency area, the ambulance that arrived with a patient had to turn back because there were no empty ICU beds. Health workers in the emergency room say that they are forced to feel helpless and witness the scene of patients dying quickly due to the lack of ICU beds.\u00a0\nLocked hope\n\n\n\nBir Hospital, the country\u2019s oldest hospital, should have been the centre for public trust in health services. However, due to a lack of skilled workforce and an economic crisis, the hospital\u2019s ICU and ward rooms are locked, and tests have also been stopped.\nAccording to hospital data, although it can operate 960 beds, only 560 beds are currently in operation. The 60-bed ICU has now decreased to 27 beds, and the 33-bed High Dependency Unit (HDU) has reduced to eight.\nFurthermore, the nine-bed Gastroenterology and Hepatology ICU room on the first floor of the surgical building has been locked for three months. Additionally, the 18-bed cabin on the second floor remains locked. Moreover, the 48-bed ortho-plastic ward and 14-bed HDU in the surgical building are also closed.\nSimilarly, the cardiology ward has decreased to 16 beds from 24, and the medical ward has reduced to 25 beds from 40. The Anaesthesia ICU on the fourth floor has been reduced to eight beds from 18, while the Neuro ICU has decreased to six beds from nine. Additionally, the nine-bed Cardio ICU has been reduced to four beds.\nFurthermore, the senior citizen ward in the old building has been closed for months, and most department services have been scaled down. According to departmental heads, the closure of wards and departments is solely due to the removal of hospital nursing staff.\nDespite the closures, the ICUs remain well-equipped with bedside monitors, central oxygen pipelines, ventilators, and other expensive equipment.\nAll of this is a snowballing effect of a decision taken by the Minister for Health and Population Mohan Bahadur Basnet. In October 2023, Basnet citing a lack of budget, decided not to extend the contract period of 276 employees of Bir Hospital. This included 185 nurses.\u00a0\nSantosh Paudel, director of Bir Hospital, acknowledged that services, from surgery to ICU, were affected when the staff were removed all at once.\n\u201cWhen ICU and HDU were operated with 90 beds, the cases of patients having to go to other hospitals were significantly fewer,\u201d he said. \u201cThings became difficult when we became short-staffed.\u201d\nRelatives of middle and low-income patients immediately search for available beds upon entering the emergency room. Unfortunately, in the yellow area, two to three patients are occupying a single bed. Additionally, the green area remains inaccessible.\nSome patients endure pain while seated in wheelchairs, while others lie on the ground, connected to saline drips. Due to delays in admission to the ward and ICU, some patients have to endure waiting times of two to three days in the emergency room.\nHealth workers at the Bir Hospital themselves are frustrated watching people in pain in the emergency room waiting for death.\n\u201cWhen will the ministry see this? How many people have to die for them to take action,\u201d said a health worker asking to remain anonymous.\nShortstaffed health services\n\nThe emergency room at Bir Hospital is overcrowded. Dr Suresh Nepal, head of the emergency room, states that up to 200 patients arrive at the emergency room every day. However, following the reduction of 12 medical officers and an equal number of nurses, the number of beds has decreased from 48 to 25.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have requested eight additional nurses from the administration on numerous occasions, but they have been unable to provide them,\u201d he says.\nPreviously, regular surgery services from 13 operation theatres have been reduced by half. According to the hospital administration\u2019s data, 40 moderate and complicated surgeries are performed daily. Previously, there were up to 80 surgeries per day.\nDr Ravin Bahadur Basnet, Head of the Department, stated that there were up to 125 operations in 6 days of the week.\nThe Urology and Neurology departments at Bir Hospital are among the busiest. To address long waiting times for operations, which had stretched to over 18 months, the hospital administration arranged for urology surgeries to be conducted six days a week, reducing the waiting period for patients to five months.\nHowever, following the removal of eight nurses and one doctor from the Department of Urology, operations are now limited to three days a week. Currently, only 40 to 45 operations are being performed within this timeframe. Consequently, as the number of operations has decreased, the waiting time has surged to nine months. Moreover, the number of beds in the Urology ward has decreased from 50 to 22.\nThe hospital administration has been unable to provide even the basic equipment necessary for surgery, citing financial constraints. They admitted to performing operations with deteriorating tools for eight years, expressing concern that urology operations could halt at any moment.\nFurthermore, the plan to conduct four kidney transplants two days a week has also fallen through.\nThe situation in Neurology is also similar. There were 125 operations per month, but now it has dropped below 90, while the 60-bed neurology service has shrunk to 40 beds. Most of the departments at Bir Hospital are facing a similar situation.\nClosing for good?\n\nDr Bhupendra Basnet, Vice-Chancellor of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), says he is unaware of the service shutdown. \n\u201cIt would be appropriate to ask the director how the hospital services are being operated,\u201d he said trying to shy away from the question.\u00a0\nHe argued that everything appeared empty due to the shifting of services from the old building to the new one. This transition created the perception of vacant space, despite the ongoing operation of services in the new facility.\nRecently, it has been discovered that the pathology service at Bir Hospital has also been severely affected. According to the laboratory staff, due to the lack of reagents, all blood tests such as thyroid, hormone, vitamin D, B12, cancer-related tests, CA 90.9, AFP, PSA, and other tests have been suspended, said Neelam Thakur. \nSimilarly, tests such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C viral load, human papillomavirus (HPV) PCR, back pain, and HLA-B 27 have been suspended.\nOut of approximately 2,000 patients who visit daily, between 700 and 1,000 patients require lab tests. However, a laboratory employee said that even patients in the emergency room are unable to undergo necessary tests. \n\u201cIf this situation persists, the lab itself may have to close,\u201d said a staff at the laboratory.\nExamination and treatment fees are very low at Bir Hospital. The government grant is the primary source of income for the hospital. However, last year, its budget was drastically cut.\u00a0\nBir Hospital received a grant of Rs 260 million last year, but it has been drastically reduced to Rs 11.6 million in the current fiscal year. Apart from that Rs 1.43 billion was allocated for regular hospital operations last year, but it has decreased to Rs 73 million in the current fiscal year.\nAccording to him, the hospital\u2019s internal revenue is limited to salaries and allowances. The hospital had an internal revenue of Rs 55 million last year but salaries of 650 employees at the National Institute of Medical Sciences (NAMS) and Bir Hospital worth Rs 53 million were covered.\nThe hospital administration has repeatedly requested Rs 920 million from the Ministry of Health this year, citing the difficulty in maintaining services. However, they were only granted Rs 190 million.\nOfficials from the Ministry of Health state that the hospital cannot be allocated the requested amount. Ministry spokesperson Dr Prakash Budhathoki explains that since the Ministry of Health lacks a budget, the request needs to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance, with proper documents and evidence to obtain the necessary funds.\u00a0\nDr Budhathoki suggests, putting a common voice together, \u201cSimply voicing concerns in the media won\u2019t resolve the issues!\u201d\n ",

    "45": "\nIt is clear that despite their challenges, LDCs lack neither the determination nor the will to catch up with the rest of the world.\nInnovation and technological advancements have significantly transformed the daily lives of many people in unprecedented ways. We often find ourselves awestruck by the pace, breadth and remarkable benefits of innovations we have seen in fields such as communication, healthcare, and sustainable energy. This is especially true for Artificial Intelligence (AI) which presents a tremendous potential to bring unprecedented efficiency to our everyday lives, transform sectors critical to our prosperity and address society\u2019s most pressing challenges.\u00a0\nYet, this optimism is tempered with concern.\u00a0\nConcern that most of these advancements and innovations remain out of reach of many around the globe, especially in the world\u2019s Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The world\u2019s 45 LDCs are facing significant challenges in harnessing the benefits of science, technology, and innovation (STI), lagging far behind more developed regions. A stark example of this gap can be seen in access to electricity; only 54.75 per cent of the population in LDCs have electricity access, a stark contrast to the near-universal coverage in OECD countries.\nInfrastructural and educational barriers in LDCs not only perpetuate inequalities but also obstruct the adoption of technological solutions that could drive positive changes in health, education, and economic development. This discrepancy puts us off-track from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with LDCs at risk of falling even further behind amid the political, economic, and social challenges posed by escalating inequality.\nBridging the innovation gap is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements and innovative practices are accessible to all and that the disparities between nations, particularly the most vulnerable and least developed ones, are reduced. In this endeavour, international cooperation, financial support, technology transfer, infrastructure development, investment, and the building of human and institutional capacities are indispensable strategies.\nIt is in this regard that the United Nations is collaborating with the government of Finland to convene a series of LDC Future Forums. The Forums will bring together policymakers and researchers from LDCs, government representatives and development partners, as well as civil society and the private sector to share ideas and lessons learned and draw evidence-based policy recommendations to optimise the utilisation of science, technology, innovation, and creativity to bolster LDCs\u2019 progress towards the SDGs.\nTechnology and LDCs\n\nWe have seen many examples of the benefits of LDCs leveraging STI for economic growth. In Nepal \u2013 with the rise of mobile and internet penetration, digital payment platforms have gained popularity. Several companies offer digital wallet services that allow users to pay bills, recharge mobile phones, purchase goods online, and transfer money digitally. Nepal is trying to reap the benefits of the growing demand for digital services. Its IT export reached USD 515 million in 2022, which was a 64.2 per cent growth compared to 2021. This accounted for 1.4 per cent of the total GDP and 5.5 per cent of total foreign exchange reserves. It indicates a huge opportunity for the country to unlock its growth potential in the digital sector by properly addressing gaps and challenges facing this sector.\u00a0\u00a0\nFurther to this, Nepal, like most LDCs, possesses untapped potential in its population, notably in the working-age population, which is expected to double in all LDCs to 1.2 billion by 2050. A well-educated and well-trained workforce in LDCs will be able to tap into the new and evolving opportunities of the global market, spur innovation, and transform their economies.\u00a0\nFor example, Rwanda has implemented several initiatives, including the Rwanda Innovation Fund, aimed at supporting tech startups and innovation-driven enterprises. Rwanda\u2019s push towards empowering innovation among its youth and becoming a tech hub is fully encapsulated in the establishment of the Kigali Innovation City, which aims to attract technology companies. These efforts are part of a broader national strategy to build a knowledge-based economy, enhancing Rwanda\u2019s competitiveness on the global stage.\nIn Burkina Faso, technological innovation is being harnessed to boost agricultural productivity through the use of mobile apps and drones to provide farmers with real-time information on weather patterns, crop prices, and agricultural techniques. While Bhutan, a recently graduated LDC, has made remarkable strides in increasing access to electricity for its population, jumping from 61 per cent in 2006 to 100 per cent in 2016 (ahead of the country\u2019s initial 2020 goal), as a result of its investments in technological innovations to harness its abundant hydropower.\u00a0\nCatching up\nIt is clear that despite their challenges, LDCs lack neither the determination nor the will to catch up with the rest of the world. They simply remain constrained by developmental challenges that have already been overcome by other nations, making international cooperation particularly relevant to their journey to achieve their development aspirations.\u00a0\nThe Finnish model of technology transfer, which marries technological advancement and innovation with capacity building and emphasises partnership and a two-way exchange of knowledge, exemplifies the kind of international cooperation that can support LDCs in their development goals and is a viable blueprint for other countries to emulate in their efforts to support global development.\u00a0\nThe 2nd LDC Future Forum which opens today in Helsinki, will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to delve into the pressing challenges of the LDCs, focusing on the role of innovation in structural transformation \u2013 exploring the impact of innovation across education, job creation, agriculture, and e-commerce.\u00a0\nAs we advance the implementation of the Doha Programme of Action (DPoA), a developmental roadmap for LDCs that was adopted at the 5th Conference for Least Developed Countries (LDC5) last year, our focus should be on supporting LDCs to overcome their unique challenges and make substantial progress towards the SDGs by leveraging science, technology and innovation. In this regard, fulfilment of the DPoA commitments and deliverables such as the proposed online University that will make STEM education accessible for LDCs is essential.\nTogether, we can create pathways to prosperity for the most vulnerable among us and ensure\u00a0they are not left behind in our shared journey toward sustainable development.\n ",
    "46": "\nPhoto: Unsplash/ Towfiqu Barbhuiya\nLooking back at the last two centuries, it is evident that the Nepali economy has never enjoyed prosperity. However, it has never been as bad as it has been over the past two years. With a lack of employment and opportunity, many have left the country and many are talking about doing so.\nAs conversations about the country\u2019s economy echo from tea shops to parliament, many are expressing concerns about an imminent crisis. What events have unfolded in the past few years to fuel these apprehensions about the economy\u2019s trajectory?\nJust as indicators like blood pressure and sugar levels can provide insights into one\u2019s health status, various economic metrics offer a glimpse into a nation\u2019s economic well-being. These include foreign exchange reserves, balance of payments, investment, trade, gross domestic product (GDP), demand for goods or services, budget, revenue, investment, interest rates, liquidity situation, and more. By delving into this data and conducting a thorough analysis, we can gain a deeper understanding of the growing concern surrounding the Nepali economy.\nCountry that loves loans\nKeeping the concern over the discouraged borrowings and defaults on loans, the base rate has also been lowered to 9.64 per cent from its 10.69 in the previous period. \nCurrently, Nepal\u2019s public debt stands at Rs 2.308 trillion. This means, that a debt of Rs 81,759 has been allocated to each Nepali citizen. This burden has sparked conversations not only among the public but also among leaders and policymakers, who are increasingly advocating for restraint when it comes to taking on additional loans.\nHowever, is Nepal\u2019s debt genuinely high? The statistics suggest otherwise. At some point, the debt-to-GDP ratio had reached 67 per cent. Presently, Nepal\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is 44 per cent. Meanwhile, Japan has a ratio of 264 per cent, Singapore has 168 per cent, and the United States has 129 per cent.\nFormer finance secretary Rameshore Khanal says, \u201cNepal should not be increasing their debt that much. Nevertheless, we must now acquire as much debt as possible and increase our expenditure. There is no need to be afraid of borrowing 50 per cent of the GDP.\u201d\nHe suggests that the government should not hesitate to raise internal debt, as it will not adversely affect the Nepali economy.\nDilaram Giri, Under Secretary of the Public Debt Management Office, also states that Nepal can bear the burden of public debt up to 50 per cent of GDP. He mentions that the loan will be spent on development and construction work, contributing to the growth of the Nepali economy.\nForeign exchange reserves sufficient for 12 months\nPhoto by Ibrahim Boran on Unsplash\nAny country should make payments in foreign currency when importing goods from abroad. Similarly, the principal and interest of the loan taken from abroad must be settled in foreign currency. Foreign investors also require foreign currency to distribute dividends. That is why countries have amassed a specific amount of foreign currency, such as US dollars and Euros.\nTwo years ago, the foreign exchange reserves decreased significantly as the country could only afford to import goods and services for six and a half months. At that time, the policymakers of Nepal were afraid that the country would head the way of Sri Lanka and put an import ban on luxurious goods. Experts argue that the government did not have to panic like that.\nLately, with the increase in remittances along with tourists, the situation has changed as the foreign reserves have increased significantly.\nExperts say the country should be cautious about how much foreign currency reserves a country like Nepal should retain. In comparison, larger economies typically maintain substantial foreign exchange reserves due to their significant volume of trade and capital flow, which often results in substantial debt payments. \nThese reserves serve various purposes, including stabilising the country\u2019s currency value or deliberately keeping it lower compared to the US dollar, meeting foreign liabilities, preventing potential economic crises domestically, and occasionally investing in domestic projects. However, it is important to note that the strength or weakness of the Nepali currency is not solely determined by the foreign exchange reserves in Nepal. Instead, it is largely influenced by the exchange rate with India.\nGenerally, there is an international consensus that foreign currency reserves should be sufficient to cover three to four months of imports. Nepal Rastra Bank has established the target of maintaining foreign exchange reserves to cover the import of goods and services for seven months.\u00a0\nNevertheless, Nepal has retained an excessive amount of foreign exchange reserves. This trend is not unique to Nepal; other countries in Asia also maintain substantial foreign currency reserves.\nAccording to Prakash Kumar Shrestha, Executive Director of the Economic Research Department of Nepal Rastra Bank. \u201cThere is no pressure on foreign exchange reserves. They should be used to improve the economy.\u201d\nStudies conducted by various universities have indicated that maintaining excessively high foreign currency reserves could result in a permanent decrease in domestic consumption. Furthermore, these studies have highlighted that an increase in foreign currency reserves is likely to lead to higher levels of foreign loans and a reduction in the loan repayment period.\nDonghyun Park and Gemma Esther B. Estrada, in their research titled, Are Developing Asia\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves Excessive? An Empirical Examination conducted at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have concluded that it is not appropriate to maintain foreign exchange reserves exceeding what can support four months of goods and services imports.\u00a0\nResearch has additionally demonstrated that the excessive accumulation of foreign assets forces developing countries to bear a loss of 1 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nIn our country, foreign investment in the stock market and real estate has not been approved. So, there is no demand for foreign currency in large quantities at once. Therefore, one of the most significant policy mistakes made by Nepal was the import ban imposed to conserve foreign currency. This decision led to an increase in smuggling and a loss of government revenue.\u00a0\nImprovements in balanced payments, current account deficit\nThe balance of payments represents the difference between foreign currency leaving Nepal and entering Nepal. A surplus of foreign exchange entering the country is beneficial for the economy, while an excess outflow is detrimental.\nMost of the transactions with foreign countries are documented in the current account. As of the end of fiscal year 2021/22, the current account deficit stood at minus Rs 623 billion, equivalent to 13 per cent of GDP. This marks the highest recorded deficit in the current account.\nPresently, the balance of payments shows a positive trend, amounting to Rs 273 billion in the initial six months of the ongoing fiscal year. The current account has also turned profitable, reaching Rs 162 billion.\u00a0\nThe implementation of control-oriented policies in the past two fiscal years led to a decline in market demand, impeding the increase in imports, and an economic slowdown has ensued as a \u2018side effect\u2019.\nIn the previous two fiscal years, the current account deficit and balance of payments issues were addressed through measures such as import restrictions. Nevertheless, there has been a notable surge in remittances. It appears that Nepal\u2019s balance of payments problem has been resolved.\nDecreased interest rates, inflationary pressures\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\nWhether individuals are inclined to take out a loan or invest is determined by the availability of loan rates. When people have access to affordable loans, they are inclined to borrow, leading to increased investment, job creation, and heightened economic activity. And when interest rates are high, people tend to be reluctant to take out loans, resulting in weakened economic activity.\nSince December 2021, Nepal faced the challenge of simultaneous high inflation and elevated interest rates for two years, reaching 7.11 per cent in the same month and surpassing the Nepal Rastra Bank\u2019s control,\u00a0\nFor the subsequent two years (22 months), Nepal experienced a period of high inflation, with peak inflation reaching around 9 per cent. Only in October of this year did inflation fall below the limit set by the Nepal Rastra Bank, i.e., 6.5 per cent. In January of the current year, inflation stood at 5.26 per cent.\nDue to increased international prices and measures taken to discourage imports of certain items, and implemented measures requiring up to 100 per cent cash margin when opening letters of credit (LC), contributing to the overall increase in prices.\u00a0\nCentral banks worldwide raised interest rates to manage inflation. Similarly, the Nepal Rastra Bank revoked the facilities provided during the Covid period, resulting in a liquidity shortage in the market and elevated interest rates. Additionally, the weighted average interest rate on loans, as determined by banks and financial institutions, reached 13.3 per cent due to the rise in the policy rate.\nHowever, with the recent easing of liquidity in the market and the NRB\u2019s reduction of the policy rate, the weighted average interest rate for banks dropped to 11.38 per cent by the end of December this year. This figure is lower than the interest rate recorded before the onset of the Covid-19 impact. Before that, the long-term interest rate averaged 12.5 per cent.\u00a0\nNevertheless, the impact of declining interest rates has not manifested in credit expansion. In the six months of the current fiscal year, credit expansion to the private sector has been only 4. Former Finance Secretary Khanal says that as businessmen are already in debt, they are not in a position to take on more loans. Additionally, half of the commercial banks are unable to provide loans due to a lack of capital.\nLoss of 150 billion in revenue\nThere has been a continuous decline in government revenue for two years. In the last fiscal year, the federal government had set a target of Rs 1.4 trillion in revenue collection, but could only collect Rs 1.01 trillion. In the current fiscal year as well, the government has set a revenue collection target of Rs 1.402 trillion. This year\u2019s revenue target is 41 per cent higher than last year, which is almost impossible to achieve.\nHowever, while Nepal\u2019s average revenue growth rate was more than 21 per cent in the 11 years before Covid, the revenue decreased by 9 per cent last year. In these six months, the revenue growth rate is only 5 per cent, while the increase is 40 per cent.\nThe government had set a revenue collection target of Rs 668 billion in the first six months of the current year. However, the collection amounted to only Rs 515 billion. Consequently, there has been a loss of Rs 153 billion in government revenue during the initial 6 months of the current year.\n\u201cIf the government increases capital expenditure, then money will reach the hands of the people, contractors, and industrialists. It will create more demand, increase consumption, and ultimately contribute to the government\u2019s revenue,\u201d says former Finance Secretary Khanal. \u201cHowever, now that the government is unable to spend, an increase in revenue does not seem likely.\u201d\nKhanal argues that if the government persists in this trend, this issue will escalate in the forthcoming year as well. Dhani Ram Sharma, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, notes that the revenue has not been gathered as anticipated, thus the expenditure has not risen.\nAttempt to reverse economic downturn\nPhoto by Towfiqu barbhuiya on Unsplash\nIn the discussion on how to revive the economy during a recession, John Maynard Keynes\u2019 theory is always considered to be significant. According to Keynesian economics, the solution to economic recession is for the government to increase spending. If the government can boost consumption and investment by reducing tax rates and increasing direct spending, an economic recession can be avoided.\nKeynes believes that if the government is practically unable to spend, it should do so in an unreasonable manner. If the government cannot undertake other projects, it should invest in monuments, such as the Egyptian pyramids. If that is not possible, the government should bury the money underground and assign mining companies the task of extracting that money.\nIn any case, the government should raise the overall demand by increasing expenditure\u2013a concept many countries around the world have adopted as the fundamental principle.\nHowever, the situation in Nepal is exactly the opposite. In the past two years, the Nepali economy has been in a recession. In the last fiscal year, economic growth continuously declined in two quarters. It is also clear that the economy has gone into the red.\nDespite this, the government has not increased capital expenditure; on the contrary, it has decreased it. Even when compared to five years ago, the share of capital expenditure in GDP was 6.3 per cent in 2018/19, which decreased to 4.3 per cent last year. In the first six months of the current year, it has decreased to only 0.9 per cent.\nToday, the private sector is currently burdened with debt and unwilling to spend. Khanal states that, in this situation, the government should increase expenditure, prioritise completing ongoing projects and allocate funds for new projects. Nevertheless, Khanal emphasises caution against escalating long-term liabilities under the guise of increasing expenses.\nDue to the government withholding payments, however immediate, the economic issues have worsened. Professor Dr Shivraj Adhikari, Head of the Central Department of Economics at Tribhuvan University, comments on the situation.\nHe highlighted that the actions of the private sector are closely tied to government spending. \u201cThe less active the government, the less active the private sector becomes. In other words, the performance of the private sector hinges on government expenditure,\u201d he explained.\nTo make the implementation of the budget effective, the constitution dictates its submission to Parliament at the end of May, but it has not worked out as planned. It has become a system in which the budget is spent in May and June. He mentioned that due to the government\u2019s inability to spend last year, the Nepali economy has slowed down this year. If there is no spending this year, both revenue and expenditure will decrease next year as well. \u201cIf we proceed in this way, the Nepali economy will remain in recession next year as well,\u201d he said.\nDecreasing demands\nClosed shutters are quite common in Kathmandu as people have decided to shut down their businesses. \nThe Confederation of Nepal Industry (CNI) recently conducted a study on the changes in demand in certain sectors over the past two years. According to the data obtained from this study, the decline in demand in the economy appears to be significant.\nIn comparison to two years ago in 2021/22, the overall demand has decreased by 37 per cent in the current year 2023/24, states the survey. Similarly, the turnover of industries has also declined by 31 per cent during that period.\nMoreover, the number of LCs opened for imports, especially for raw materials, has decreased by 32 per cent. Considering these three figures, domestic demand in the country has seen a substantial decrease.\nDuring this period, the sales of the automobile sector appear to have decreased the most by 77 per cent. Demand has decreased by 45 per cent in cement, 53 per cent in engineering and construction, 50 per cent in plastic, and 46 per cent in other industries.\nThis fact has also been accepted by the International Monetary Fund. In the third review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the IMF noted that weak domestic demand has affected the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure despite solving the foreign exchange problem.\nImport and domestic industry capacity utilisation data provide a picture of whether domestic demand has decreased or increased in the country. Looking at it in that way, imports decreased by 16.1 per cent in the last fiscal year 2022/23, while they have decreased by 3 per cent in the six months of the current fiscal year. The economic activity study of the Nepal Rastra Bank has shown that the industry was able to utilise only 49.8 per cent of the total capacity in the last fiscal year 2022/23.\nWhen there is a sharp decrease in demand, there is an economic belief that both the direct expenditure of the government and the money provided by the central bank through the financial system should be increased. However, due to money in the financial system, credit expansion is very slow. In the private sector, credit growth from banks has increased by only 5 per cent.\nIt seems that the demand has decreased due to the rapid migration of young people abroad. In the last year, 768,000 young people went for foreign employment. If we calculate only about 100,000 more who go to study, half of 900,000 young people have already left the country in the last year. \u201cWhen the youth who consume the most go abroad, there will be a decrease in demand,\u201d says the official.\nProblem created by the wrong monetary policy\nRepresentational graph\nFormer Finance Secretary Khanal states that the root of the problems seen in the economy now is the wrong monetary policy. \u201cAfter Covid, the budget missed providing relief to the people. It brought subsidies and loans for which it was praised. And the Nepal Rastra Bank did not correct that policy in time.\u201d\nKhanal argues that if the Nepal Rastra Bank had stated that this system would be applied only for six months when the policy was introduced, or if it had been corrected immediately, the current problem would not have arisen.\nThe lockdown imposed in March 2020 was gradually eased from November of the same year. Despite the easing of restrictions, Covid-related facilities and infrastructure were not promptly removed as expected. This delay, extending over 18 months, significantly impacted the Nepali economy, causing considerable challenges. Critics argue that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) should have taken proactive measures to provide ample liquidity and closely scrutinised the allocation of loans when interest rates dropped.\nNevertheless, Khanal says that monetary policy cannot currently resolve this problem. \n\u201cThere needed to be meticulous monitoring during that period. The businessmen acknowledged that they purchased land as they got a loan at that time. Consequently, the stock market soared to 3,200 points, and imports surged by 36-37 per cent. However, there was no inquiry into the reasons behind these occurrences,\u201d says Khanal.\n\u201cAmidst the Covid pandemic, the private sector has been affected by low-interest loans, making it unable to acquire additional loans,\u201d he continues.\u00a0\nWith no conducive environment for subsequent investments, he says it was time for the government to take the initiative and invest when the private sector is refraining from borrowing.\nInternal debt, Khanal says, is not a concern for the economy. \n\u201cIf the government spends by taking loans now to sustain the economy, the revenue will rise tomorrow, so the debt will be repaid,\u201d he said.\nHe points out that a major portion of the loans has been directed towards imports, real estate, and shares, resulting in minimal returns. \n\u201cBusinessmen invested money in imports and real estate, but the returns on these investments were not realised,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when they extended loans, they couldn\u2019t secure the payments, creating an incomplete cycle of business.\u201d\u00a0\nOur debt is nearly equal to the GDP. Nevertheless, our economic growth is only 4.5 per cent,\u201d he states. \u201cThis indicates that loans do not contribute significantly to economic growth.\u201d\n\u201cCurrently, the government is taking loans from banks and giving them to the local level, but the municipalities have not spent them and kept them in commercial banks,\u201d he said. The official argues that since the banks were able to use the 60 per cent savings kept at the local level, they are not enthusiastic about giving loans.\n\u201cBecause there is no benefit in giving that money to common people. The cost of that is expensive,\u201d said the official. \u201cBanks want to give to big businessmen, however, they are not in a position to take it now.\u201d\nIt appears that those in the government\u2019s leadership are merely giving verbal support to economic reform. However, the urgency and gravity of the reform do not seem to have been internalised anywhere. Increasing government expenditure is a crucial step in addressing the issue. Nevertheless, sources within the ministry indicate that the Ministry of Finance is advising against further spending due to a lack of resources for various projects.\nIt is essential to maximise the utilisation of available resources, and if necessary, amend the budget to expedite development expenditure through additional loans. Acceleration of infrastructure construction is imperative, even if it entails removing employees causing hindrances and incurring expenses by lingering on projects.\u00a0\nAs the Prime Minister suggested, this should be achieved by working in three shifts, prioritising infrastructure projects with a significant impact on economic growth. Whether it\u2019s a contractor or an employee, persisting excuses based on others\u2019 opinions the \u2018last opportunity\u2019 as proclaimed by the Prime Minister, will be in jeopardy.\n ",

    "55": "\nPetroglyphs in Kag Nyimba that are still intact.\nPetroglyphs, commonly known as rock carvings, have been created during prehistoric and early historic times. These serve as crucial documents representing the cultural makeup, physical environment, social compulsion, and economic activities of the period when they were made. These sites are quintessential for comprehending not just our ancestors but also the entire civilization of mankind.\nIn Nepal, petroglyph sites are rare, with only a few rock art sites identified in the Nepali Himalayas. The first petroglyphs were discovered in 1993 by the team of the German Research Council (DFG) Focus Program \u2018Tibet-Himalayas\u2019 at the Kak (Kag) Nyimba site, located near the present settlement of Eklae Bhati. \nThe same team found two other petroglyph sites in Samar and Te (Tsuk?) in 1995, all in the lower region of Mustang. In later years, between 2013 and 2017, I discovered three more sites with rock paintings and rock carvings in Dhetang, Shar-ri region of Lo (Upper Mustang). It is worth noting that another rock art site is said to exist outside of Mustang in Nepal, but its whereabouts and contents have not been independently verified.\nFinding Kag Nyimba\nBroken art panels at the lower end of Kag Nyimba.\nKag Nyimba, also pronounced as Kak Nyimba, is the very first rock engraving site discovered in Nepal by a team of DFG researchers in 1993. The site was discovered accidentally while the team was studying the nearby abandoned settlement called Kag Nyimba (2,270 m), which is also the namesake of the petroglyph site. The site is situated in the Kali Gandaki Valley, located approximately two kilometres south of Kagbeni Village. The engraved rock fragments are mostly located on the riverbed of the Kali Gandaki River.\nThe engravings at Kag Nyimba were created using primitive tools such as simple stones chisels and other primitive tools. The DFG Team working closely, led by Perdita Pohle identified over 1,200 engravings that are spread out across two large areas of rock that are approximately 200 metres apart. The findings of which were published in separate volumes in 2000 and 2001. \nThe engravings were created over different periods and feature various motifs, including footprints, handprints, circles, semi-circles, flowers, horses, spirals, human figures, and more. Additionally, there are carvings of animals such as yaks, wild yaks, blue sheep, dogs, deer, and cattle-like figures. The site also has engravings of various symbols, including Buddhist and pre-Buddhist symbols, axes, and other tools, as well as cup marks, labyrinths, and geometric signs in various sizes and positions.\nPre-historic engravings of footmark in Kag Nyimba.\nThe petroglyphs found in the Kag Nyimba sites are believed to have been created during various epochs, spanning from the pre-historic to the historic period. However, it is not possible to determine their exact age just by studying the images themselves. \nAccording to the research conducted by Perdita Pohle and Willibald Haffner from DFG, as well as the research carried out by Prakash Darnal and I preliminary research, some of the carvings can be traced back to prehistoric periods such as the Neolithic Period (approximately 10,000 BCE) and others to the Iron Age (between approximately 1,500 BCE and 500 BCE). \nSome images can also be linked to historical periods, mostly from the 11th to 15th century, but a few could also date back to the pre-7th century. The presence of engravings with Buddhist and pre-Buddhist inscriptions makes it easier to assume that these engravings are from the recent past. It is also safe to assume that all these images are connected to the present and past indigenous communities of the region. They are essential relics of the past epochs that provide evidence of the lifestyle, belief system, and way of life of our ancestors.\nIrreparable blunder\nCement spilt on over the engraving at Kag Nyimba.\nThe negligence of the local authorities has led to the destruction of this significant cultural heritage site of Kag Nyimba. In an attempt to prevent water flow from directly hitting the rock surface with engravings, the authorities constructed a concrete wall. Unfortunately, this decision resulted in a disaster as the contractor poured cement mortar all over the engravings, destroying hundreds of engravings that were thousands of years old. \nAdditionally, the use of heavy machinery and a crawler dozer partially broke and damaged some art panels. Consequently, the Kag Nyimba petroglyph site now lies in tatters. More than half of the previously reported engravings have been damaged and discarded, while some have disappeared and are unaccounted for. The concrete barrage that was built to protect the site is also not fully functional. The water flow from the Kali Gandaki is gradually destroying the engravings as the art panels are still exposed to the direct flow of water.\nHow the local authorities and the Department of Archaeology in Nepal approved and executed the construction work that destroyed the Kag Nyimba heritage site is incomprehensible. All parties involved should be held responsible for the physical destruction of this site that is thousands of years old. \n\n\nIt is unacceptable that such sites are destroyed for the benefit of a select few. The construction work was carried out without proper monitoring in a fragile and sensitive area, which is unforgivable. \nThis site could very well be a sacred site, a place of ritual gatherings, or a cremation ground. This incident has raised questions about the competency of the Department of Archaeology, which is responsible for protecting and preserving such sites. \nThe department must be held accountable and answer for what went wrong at Kag Nyimba so that such negligence does not happen again. \n\nUnfortunately, the damage to Kag Nyimba is irreversible, but we must work to protect the remaining petroglyph sites in Mustang before they too are lost forever. Immediate action must be taken by the authorities to rectify the damage and prevent further destruction of the remaining engravings at the site.\n ",

    "61": "\nBeing a developing nation struggling with slow GDP growth and limited industrialisation, the rapid increase in electricity consumption poses significant challenges. Photo: Aryan Dhimal\nIn today\u2019s context, Nepal is actively pursuing a transition towards clean energy, harnessing the potential of hydropower, solar, and wind. A bold declaration was made at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP 26) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the country committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2045.\nHowever, it is essential to recognise that this energy transition is a complex and gradual process, far from a quick fix or an overnight transformation. Its success depends on several critical key factors, including the rapid generation of clean energy within the country, the establishment of reliable infrastructure for energy transmission, and the implementation of effective and well-organised distribution systems.\nAs Nepal approaches self-sufficiency in energy generation, the country\u2019s current focus is on the development of transmission lines and distribution infrastructure. This significant attention comes from the objective of expanding energy consumption inside the country, which has been driven by growing consumer and per capita consumption, with a major focus on the residential, industrial, and transportation sectors.\nThe country mostly relies on run-of-river (ROR) hydropower projects, which by nature result in inconsistent hydroelectricity generation throughout the year and the problem of water spillage and loss during the wet season because of limited national consumption articulates the necessity of exporting excess energy produced to the neighbouring country. \nThe problem of limited transmission\u00a0lines and distribution networks, which are exacerbated by significant challenges resulting from\u00a0government bureaucracy, policy issues, local community concerns, environmental issues, and land acquisition difficulties demands immediate attention and address.\nThe urgency to address these issues has surged due to the ongoing construction of 3,000+ MW power projects, processing of PPAs for 10,000+ MW projects, and India\u2019s interest in importing 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal, potentially expanding to exports to Bangladesh. \nThis has shifted the focus to developing Nepal\u2019s transmission lines, cross-border infrastructure, and distribution networks.\nLack of visionary planning\nRepresentational picture of the shift to electricity from petroleum\nSurprisingly, there appears to be a lack of ambitious plans or preparations for increasing electricity consumption in the nation, with a notable disregard for the residential sector. While the ongoing enhancements to the existing transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as the addition of new hydro-projects, will naturally play a role in boosting consumption, it\u2019s crucial to underscore that these measures alone would not be sufficient. \nMeeting the forecasted energy demand in the coming years requires a proactive approach that involves a thorough analysis of feedback from stakeholders and a comprehensive strategy to enhance domestic electricity consumption.\nNepal\u2019s electricity consumers are mainly in the domestic category, making up about 92.32 per cent of the total, and they consume over 41 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity. On the other hand, industrial consumers represent only 1.31 per cent but consume around 38 per cent of the total electricity. \nDespite slower industrial growth, these sectors significantly drive up electricity usage. The residential sector, responsible for household needs like cooking and lighting, accounts for 63.2 per cent of the total energy\u00a0mix (626 Petajoules), primarily relying on fuel wood (85 per cent) and LPG (2.76 per cent). \nIn contrast, Nepal\u2019s electricity consumption stands at 9.3 billion units. Electric appliances are much more energy efficient, with modern stoves achieving up to 90 per cent efficiency. In simple terms, if Nepal were to replace only fuelwood and LPG with fully electric appliances for cooking purposes, the country could potentially consume more than twice its current total electric energy consumption.\nBeing a developing nation struggling with slow GDP growth and limited industrialisation, the rapid increase in electricity consumption poses significant challenges. \nIt is widely recognised that electricity consumption, GDP, and industrialisation are closely interconnected, with a direct and proportional relationship. However, obstacles like political complexities, an inadequate regulatory framework, and imbalances in accountability and organisational autonomy have hindered progress. \nThe Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), responsible for electricity transmission and distribution, has faced criticism for prioritising electricity exports to India over meeting domestic demand, despite acknowledging the need to boost domestic consumption.\nThe NEA has made notable progress in increasing generation capacity and reducing electricity imports from India. However, a closer look reveals a key oversight: inadequate attention to residential consumers, who are a major energy consuming sector.\nFurthermore, while NEA\u2019s efforts to develop cross-border transmission lines for exports as well as the national distribution network are commendable, there\u2019s a significant issue: the lack of focus on consumer safety standards and regulations in the current Electricity Distribution Regulation, 2018. \nThis oversight needs correction. The institution and the public should shift their focus from simply increasing consumption to improving the quality of life through modern electric technology, which can positively impact the country\u2019s economic growth.\nThe major challenges may arise in managing peak energy demand during the transition to fully electric households, including tariff structuring and safety standards in transmission and distribution. Notably, the current regulation lacks specific provisions for consumer safety and includes an exemption for the NEA from liability in wiring-related consumer losses or injuries.\nThe current regulations highlight the constraints of a substantial energy regulatory authority and a significant oversight in safeguarding consumer interests. These deficiencies have the potential to hinder the government\u2019s efforts to increase electricity consumption, particularly within the residential sector. Therefore NEA should prioritise research aimed at analysing and enhancing existing regulatory provisions.\nSafety concerns in domestic electric appliances\nInduction Cooktop. Photo: Freepik\nHigh-power electric devices, like stoves, heaters, geysers, and other modern appliances, present inherent risks due to their substantial power consumption. Ensuring the safe use of these devices requires well-engineered residential wiring systems.\nIncidents such as fatalities caused by gas geysers in bathrooms during winter and fires resulting from heaters have tarnished the reputation of these appliances and led to a reduction in their usage, despite a lack of user awareness and safety practices.\nSimilar negative impacts could affect widely used domestic electric appliances like cooking stoves, water heaters, and electric geysers, posing a potential threat to government initiatives aimed at increasing national electricity consumption.\nGenerally, third-party technicians or contractors often handle electrical work for residential consumers, while the NEA disclaims liability. This regulatory gap raises concerns about safety and accountability. It\u2019s important to note that this does not mean the NEA should bear sole responsibility for adverse outcomes, as that may not be feasible. \nAdditional regulations can address safety issues, including guidelines for wiring repair, electrical safety practices in new construction, and engineering approvals. Enforcing licensed electricians in newly constructed homes and exploring safety standard upgrades are vital for Nepal\u2019s long-term power consumption goals.\n ",

Photo: Santosh Chaudhari/Division Forest Office Bardiya.\n\nNepal\u2019s government remains undecided on how to manage tigers captured after attacking or killing humans, even as different stakeholders make varied suggestions on dealing with the urgent issue of these so-called \u2018problem animals\u2019.\nThe rising incidence of human-tiger conflict is a direct consequence of Nepal\u2019s\u00a0stunning success\u00a0in conserving tigers, which has seen the population of the endangered big cat\u00a0nearly triple since 2010. With that\u00a0increase, the number of tigers that authorities have determined must be removed from their habitat for human safety has also gone up.\nToday, there are 18 of these apex predators in captivity, stretching the capacity of the government to feed and accommodate them.\n\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t taken any new decision so far on how to manage the captive tigers,\u201d said Bed Kumar Dhakal, a spokesperson for the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.\nLast year, the country\u2019s environment minister proposed, controversially, that sport hunters be\u00a0allowed to kill\u00a0\u201cproblem tigers,\u201d thereby addressing human-tiger conflict while also generating revenue that can be invested back into conservation. Other government officials have called for gifting the animals to zoos abroad, while NGOs have lobbied for the establishment of rescue centres at the provincial level. Some academics have suggested simply shooting tigers deemed dangerous to human life.\n\u201cAfter a lot of backlash over the proposal to allow sport hunting of problem tigers, the minister hasn\u2019t raised the proposal again,\u201d a wildlife department official familiar with the development said, asking not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cBut the minister continues to speak about human-tiger conflict whenever he gets the forum to do so.\u201d\nNo money for tigers\nPhoto by Keyur Nandaniya on Unsplash\nAt a recent event related to conservation, Forest Minister Birendra Mahato said that while local communities\u00a0continue to suffer\u00a0because of rising tiger numbers, they go overlooked by policymakers who do not ever have to deal with the problem and are more focused instead on conservation.\nAccording to the Wildlife Department, which is a unit of the Environment Ministry, it costs around Rs 500,000 to Rs 700,000 to feed a tiger in captivity every year. At this rate, the environment ministry, which has an annual budget of around USD 125 million for all of its programs, would have to allocate nearly USD 100,000 just to feed and look after the 18 tigers currently in captivity.\nThe\u00a0Tiger Action Conservation Action Plan\u00a0(2023-2032) also identifies problem tigers as one of the challenges in tiger conservation. According to the document, 38 people died in tiger attacks in Nepal between 2019 and 2023, with most of the incidents taking place outside protected areas, in corridors connecting tiger habitats in Nepal and India.\n\u201cManaging an increasing number of problematic tigers remains a daunting task, both financially and technically, for protected area managers. Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\u201d it says. The plan calls for the development of a comprehensive protocol to cope with the rescue, handling and rehabilitation of these tigers, but stops short of identifying concrete ways to manage them.\nFor their part, NGOs and their conservation partners say the government must invest in rescue centers and enclosures where the tigers can be looked after. However, none have committed any funding or provided any concrete proposals to that end, the wildlife department official said.\nGiving tigers away\nA tiger in Bardia National Park. Image by Shyamschaudhary via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0). \nAnother option the government is looking at is giving the animals to foreign zoos. However, neither the wildlife department nor the foreign ministry has actively pitched the idea to any foreign government. Historically, also, foreign zoos have preferred animals such as greater one-horned rhinos over tigers for such diplomatic gestures. According to wildlife department records, Nepal has gifted 26 rhinos to foreign governments and zoos since 1985. Only one tiger, a dead one at that, has ever been gifted to a foreign government: a pelt and a skull that Nepal sent to a Saudi prince in 1998.\nDhakal from the wildlife department said the government is working on guidelines for provincial governments to establish zoos where they can house tigers for educational purposes. The lack of such guidelines has often been cited as the reason animals continue to be held in inhumane conditions in so-called mini zoos across the country. With even the central zoo in Kathmandu having limited space and resources for animals such as tigers, critics say provincial zoos won\u2019t have the capacity to manage problem tigers.\nMeanwhile, at a recent grassland management discussion in Kathmandu, a wildlife manager from South Africa suggested that Nepal shouldn\u2019t shy away from killing problem tigers. It\u2019s something that wildlife practitioners don\u2019t like doing, but that\u2019s the most efficient way to manage problem tigers, he said. Shooting the tiger and burying it in an unmarked area gets rid of all the issues, he added. But the practice could be against Indigenous beliefs and principles of nonviolence, critics say.\n\u201cWe hope that the government will soon decide which approach it wants to take,\u201d Dhakal said.\n\nThis story\u00a0first appeared on Mongabay\u00a0and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.\n ",

    "73": "\nSketch for representation\nNepal experienced a notable change in its political landscape, signalling the dawn of a fresh era characterised by increased political empowerment, especially among the younger generation during the 2022 election cycle.\nThis change, with youth in politics, has developed faith among the people that the country will progress with the energy of the youth force in policy-making positions.\u00a0\nNepal\u2019s history is saturated with instances where youth acted as catalysts for change. From the People\u2019s Movement, the passion and drive of the youth facilitated transformative shifts in the nation\u2019s political landscape. Despite their significant contributions, the youth often lacked recognition and representation in mainstream politics, their sacrifices overshadowed by the pursuit of power and position by established leaders.\nPresent scenario\nRastriya Swatantra Party\u2019s newly elected lawmaker Sobita Gautam in her victory rally, in Kathmandu, on Wednesday, November 23, 2022. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale \nRecent elections showcased a burgeoning foundation for youth in politics and policymaking. According to the election commission\u2019s press release, there was an encouraging more than 40 per cent increase in youth representation in local elections, with 11 per cent of candidates falling in the 21-30 age group and around 30 per cent in the 31-40 bracket.\nNotable victories, such as Balendra Shah\u2018s mayoral win in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, signalled a turning point, fostering a trend of supporting young and independent candidates over those from established political parties.\nThis shift birthed the emergence of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, led by media personality Rabi Lamichhane, showcasing a promising wave of new faces and youth in politics.\nFederal elections also witnessed a 32 per cent surge in youth participation compared to 2017. The influence of the youth in campaigns like the \u201cNo Not Campaign\u201d resulted in the defeat of renowned politicians, signalling a positive message for Nepal\u2019s political landscape.\nProbable reasons for increased interest\nThe heightened involvement of Nepal\u2019s youth in politics stems from several key factors. Access to enhanced educational opportunities has empowered them with a deeper understanding of governance and their pivotal role in shaping the nation\u2019s future.\nConcurrently, the rapid increment of social media and technological advancements has provided a robust platform for their voices, enabling seamless advocacy for change and support mobilisation.\nFurthermore, a burgeoning desire for societal change, combined with a heightened awareness of social inequities and environmental issues, has ignited intense passion among the younger generation to actively engage in political discourse.\nAdditionally, evolving leadership prospects within some political spheres have facilitated the rise of young leaders, acknowledged for their potential to offer innovative solutions to enduring challenges.\nChallenges\nHowever, the path for youth entering politics is not free of obstacles. The major among these challenges is the insufficiency of employment opportunities, leading to a stark unemployment rate of 19.2 per cent among Nepali youth, significantly higher than the overall rate of 2.7 per cent around the globe.\nConsequently, many seek opportunities abroad due to inadequate prospects locally. This migration of skilled professionals contributes to a detrimental brain drain, impacting Nepal\u2019s growth.\nThe reluctance of established leaders to integrate young politicians into significant roles and the restrictive constitutional and legal provisions further limit youth representation in political processes.\nBarriers like minimum age requirements for contesting elections and participation in constitutional committees hinder the infusion of fresh perspectives, impeding youth representation and engagement in policymaking.\nFuture path\nTo harness the full potential of Nepal\u2019s youth, the country must create a conducive environment through supportive legal frameworks and electoral processes.\nImplementing comprehensive youth policies with defined action plans, realistic timelines, and adequate budgets is crucial.\nEmpowering the youth as proactive change-makers necessitates redefining their roles and equipping them with decision-making skills, enabling substantial participation in shaping Nepal\u2019s political landscape.\n ",

    "78": "\nPhoto by Andrew Stutesman on Unsplash\nNepal\u2019s constitution was promulgated in 2015. According to the constitution, Nepal can conduct an independent foreign policy guided by the principles outlined in the United Nations Charter, non-alignment, the Panchsheel principles, international law, and the norms of global peace.\nAn article in the constitution requires the review of previously concluded treaties and the establishment of new treaties and agreements based on principles of equality and mutual interest. These provisions, consistent with past constitutions of Nepal, suggest that the country\u2019s foreign policy lacks innovation and has remained unchanged for an extended period.\nReasons for stagnation \nNepal encounters both external and internal challenges in its foreign policy and diplomacy, affecting the overall effectiveness of its approach.\nNepal grapples with external challenges including shifts in the global power balance, considerations of immediate neighbours, and conflicting interests involving China, India, and Western nations. Internally, the effectiveness of Nepal\u2019s foreign policy is impeded by various challenges such as political, administrative, and economic issues.\nSince the restoration of democracy, Nepal has lacked well-defined drafts of foreign policy, leading to a situation of ambiguity. This ambiguity at the policy level poses a challenge, causing confusion in adopting concrete policies. When a state grapples with ambiguity, the challenges it faces can impact national interests.\nIn Nepal\u2019s political landscape, there is often a lack of consensus among politicians on national agendas. This disagreement extends to the transformation of ideologies, resulting in political conflicts. Additionally, Nepali leaders tend to prioritise a cadre-oriented mindset over the concerns of the general population, hindering the effectiveness of Nepal\u2019s foreign policy.\nThe challenges\nFile: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nNepal\u2019s inability to implement the existing policies too is hindering the effectiveness of Nepal\u2019s foreign policy, creating an economic challenge. The absence of development models for various provinces in evolving contexts further complicates matters\nAdditionally, the lack of well-thought-out plans for both domestic and external connectivity adds to the difficulties. The sluggish progress in reconstructing infrastructure damaged by the earthquake, coupled with a deficiency in policies and actions to revitalise major industries, highlights the economic challenges impeding the development of Nepal\u2019s foreign policy.\nWhat has not helped is the absence of institutions and preparedness for the socialist economic model outlined in the constitution. This has led to further economic challenges. As the country follows a federal government model, Nepal faces challenges in the execution of economic diplomacy by provincial governments and their relations with other countries. This complexity arises within the federal and foreign systems, particularly since the country\u2019s foreign affairs are centralised under the control of the federal government.\nThere is noticeable excessive polarisation among governmental institutions, ranging from the local to the central level. This polarisation results in confusion and contradictory situations between federal and provincial institutions. Moreover, there exists a struggle between process-oriented and result-oriented approaches, along with procedural complexity, posing administrative challenges.\nExcessive polarisation is evident among governmental institutions from the local to the central level. This leads to confusion and contradictory situations between federal and provincial institutions. Additionally, there is a struggle between process-oriented and result-oriented approaches, coupled with procedural complexity, which are administrative challenges. \nThere is a noticeable lack of research-based attitude of civil servants, many of whom seem to work solely for the sake of it. These factors collectively result in a dominance of spending characteristics over actions driven by tangible results.\nUnreliable appointments and security matters\nAlong with all the above-mentioned challenges, the hindrance to the effectiveness of foreign policy in the constitution is the lack of sound criteria for appointing diplomats as political appointees.\nMoreover, those who are appointed as diplomats and political appointees, lack training. Without proper training institutions and an environment of diplomatic knowledge production, there would not be uniformity in diplomatic practices in all receiving states. This might create problems in diplomatic relations.\nBesides, Nepal also faces security challenges for youths working abroad, natural resources and more.\nLikewise, foreign policy cannot be formulated and implemented unilaterally. Integration of other ministries and institutions is quite essential. But in Nepal, such type of initiation is never brought out into practice and Nepal has weak inter-ministerial cooperation.\nTherefore, Nepal should rethink and revise foreign policy comprehensively in changing geopolitical scenarios for its effectiveness.\n ",
    "79": "\n\nThe Nepali rupee (NPR) has been pegged to the Indian rupee (INR) for a long time.\u00a0The current fixed pegging of 100 INR to 160 NPR was established in 1993 and has been in practice for over thirty years now. The fixed exchange rate of 1.6 was determined based on the macroeconomic and historical factors of the two countries that were relevant at the time of peg establishment. \nMany of those decision factors have now either changed or do not exist; however, the fixed pegging scheme continues to be in circulation the same way as it has been since the beginning. Surprisingly, Nepal appears to be in \u2018no rush\u2019 to reform the pegging policy, at least, for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this context, it is important to note that while the pegging mechanism is fixed; it still requires active control of the NPR/INR rate through foreign exchange interventions.\u00a0In the process, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) decides on a buy-sell spread around the official 1.6 rates based on the current market conditions.\u00a0 \nFor instance, when the market exchange rate exceeds 1.6 NPR per INR, NRB purchases US dollars to appreciate the rupee back to the official peg.\u00a0 This strategy, also called a Band-Aid model (keeping exchange rates within a predetermined range), involves regulating excess rupee liquidity and preventing significant deviations from the 1.6 rate threshold.\u00a0This arrangement has impacted Nepal\u2019s economy by affecting trade, monetary policy, and overall business commercial stability.\u00a0This article argues that a much-needed reform related to the fixed pegging policy cannot wait too long based on the current and emerging economic realities.\nWhy do we need to reform the fixed pegging?\nFile: Nepal Rastra Bank\nThe fixed pegging was required back then to address the currency crisis related to Nepal\u2019s balance of payments.\u00a0The proponents of the fixed pegging claim that the fixed exchange rate helped mitigate uncertainties in business transactions, provided confidence and predictability in the Nepali currency market and helped bring stability to Nepal\u2019s trade partnership with India.\u00a0 \nWhile these arguments are largely held in times of economic and political instability in the country, the other side of the story is utterly overlooked by the policymakers.\u00a0There are convincing hard facts and evidence to support the case that the time has finally arrived for monetary policy reform grounded on the last three decades of fixed-pegging experience.\nFirst and foremost, given the size of the economy, Nepal does not have any influence on India\u2019s monetary policies; however, it is essentially compelled to adopt them. Nepal\u2019s actions are dictated by the decisions made by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) whenever it decides to raise or lower interest rates.\u00a0 Likewise, when the Indian rupee\u2019s value strengthens or weakens against key global currencies, Nepal\u2019s currency is also affected.\u00a0This fixed pegging approach essentially brings in inflation and monetary fluctuations from India into Nepal and increases the volatility of prices in the Nepali markets.\nSecond, the fixed pegging arrangement promotes an informal flow of funds between the two countries. This can potentially result in loss of taxable revenue from transactions made in the informal economy.\u00a0 Nepal imposes certain capital restrictions and maintains relatively restrained interest rates compared to India. This dynamic encourages Indian funds to be informally moved into Nepal to exploit the interest rate differences causing further worsening of the trade deficits due to under-reported or hidden transactions.\u00a0\u00a0\nThird, the unwavering 1.6 exchange rate has caused a considerable overvaluation of NPR against currencies other than the INR.\u00a0The impact of this situation has affected Nepal\u2019s ability to compete in international trade.\u00a0The consequences were evident from the relentless geometric growth of total trade deficits in the past decades, in which a substantial portion of the deficits is directly or indirectly tied to the fixed pegging.\u00a0\u00a0\nFourth, Nepal\u2019s current account and balance of payments have deteriorated over time.\u00a0As time goes by, the fixed pegging approach further intensifies its economic dependence on India, making it vulnerable to supply shortages and market distortions.\u00a0 \nPhoto by Ibrahim Boran on Unsplash\nFor example, in the recent Covid pandemic, border closures led to shortages of essential goods within Nepal.\u00a0 Similarly, the hardships during the multiple unofficial economic blockades in the past few decades are still fresh in Nepalese memory.\u00a0 In those situations, NRB must be proactive in building up necessary currency reserves as a protective measure to escape the cycle of deep dependence on India.\u00a0\nFifth, the NRB\u2019s frequent actions in defence of the peg causes a rapid depletion of the nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves.\u00a0 For example, foreign reserves shrank from USD 9.5 billion to USD 9.1 billion between July 2021 and May 2022 due to NRB\u2019s selling of dollars in the market (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2022). This unsustainable exhaustion of foreign currency has hindered Nepal\u2019s domestic financial markets, institutions, and capital account activities.\u00a0Thus, in essence, Nepal has practically outsourced its monetary and exchange rate policies to India.\nAdditionally, there has been a notable change in economic relations between India and Nepal in recent times. In 1993, the introduction of the peg happened when India had a significant influence on Nepal\u2019s commerce, trade, and economy. However, since then, Nepal has made a conscious effort to expand and diversify its trade opportunities by establishing relationships with various countries such as China, Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union, and the United States. This has resulted in the trade patterns with India going down at a modest pace.\u00a0 As of 2021, the percentage of trade between Nepal and India stands at about 60 per cent.\nFurthermore, while Nepal\u2019s economy still relies heavily on agriculture and remittances. Nepal is seeing an increase in foreign direct investment from countries other than India, particularly in sectors like infrastructure, hydroelectricity, and tourism.\u00a0\nIn contrast, India is undergoing rapid expansion of service industries and heightened private spending. \u00a0 India is attracting multinational companies and heavily investing in software technologies. These differing structural trajectories of the two economies make the original rationale of Nepal adopting India\u2019s monetary policy less compelling.\u00a0\u00a0\nTherefore, the need for Nepal to establish monetary policies tailored to its unique economic framework has become more pressing than ever.\u00a0 Now is indeed a critical moment for Nepal to deeply consider the monetary policy reforms concerning the fixed currency peg.\nThe path forward\nA gradual and calibrated approach is necessary for a transition strategy. This requires a thorough assessment, research, and strategic planning before making a significant adjustment. Over the past three decades of fixed pegging, Nepal\u2019s policy-making institutions such as NRB should have learned from what has worked and what has not. By implementing effective macroeconomic management and applying these lessons learned, Nepal can secure ongoing trade and remittance flows without being tethered to a fixed peg.\nMore importantly, there are viable alternatives available.\u00a0 For example, implementing a managed floating exchange rate regime that involves fixing the exchange rate in relation to a combination of four major global currencies \u2013 the Indian rupee, Chinese Yuan, US Dollar, and Euro.\u00a0 This mix could be tailored to Nepal\u2019s major trading partners.\u00a0 In this scenario, NRB would play an active role in managing the exchange rate, preserving stability while introducing a degree of adaptability.\u00a0 According to the IMF, the floating regimes are actually gaining more traction in recent years.\u00a0\n\nAnother best option could be to follow the model adopted by many other countries in the world such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Panama, etc., in which local currencies are pegged with the US dollar, which is perhaps the most stable and secured currency in the world.\nNevertheless, the question of the peg should align with the broader discussions on Nepal\u2019s development model.\u00a0 NRB\u2019s research department and think tanks should conduct extensive technical studies comparing the peg regime\u2019s efficacy to alternative strategies proposed.\u00a0 The decision should be driven based on economic hard facts rather than on geo-political factors. Extensive debates involving all stakeholders can then find the way forward for a truly sovereign monetary system. Thus, while the INR peg has fulfilled its purpose for more than 30 years, its limitations are now evident and cannot be simply ignored.\u00a0 The necessary monetary reform in this regard is imminent.\u00a0\n ",
    "80": "\nPhoto by Markus Winkler/Pexels\nSandwiched between the Asian giants of China and India, Nepal has occupied a precarious position amid the South Asian regional power dynamics throughout its history. Its vulnerable geography and internal political and economic weaknesses have led to deeply rooted security challenges that have profoundly impacted policymaking.\nAs Nepal transitions to a new federal governance structure, formulating policies that balance external pressures and internal fractures will become critical. The National Security Policy 2016 issued by Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Defence provides a key definition of national security as the \u201ccomplete safeguard of a country\u201d encompassing multiple domains.\nHowever, operationalising this is complex, given Nepal\u2019s positioning on the world map. This entails protecting matters of national interest from both external intervention and internal pressures.\nThe impact of neighbours\nNepal\u2019s new Pokhara airport might fall prey to India-China tussle. Onlinekhabar graphics\nNepal\u2019s national aspirations and vital interests are informed by its situation between India and China in terms of history, economy, politics, and ethnic composition within its borders. Its lack of military power and development compared to its powerful neighbours has also constrained Nepal\u2019s independent policymaking over the years.\nNepal\u2019s security priorities and strategies have been fundamentally impacted by recurring border tensions with India and China. Regional moves perceived by India as against its interests have been seen in previous economic blockades and strained ties. Meanwhile, issues like hosting Tibetan refugees have also emerged in relations with China.\nBalancing these power dynamics has been necessary for Nepal to chart its delicate security approach. Furthermore, political instability and ethnic tensions internally also pose security threats that link with and exacerbate geopolitical issues. For example, the Maoist insurgency from 1996-2006 stemmed from grievances of marginalised groups.\nContinued ethnic violence even after the resulting Comprehensive Peace Agreement illustrates these enduring societal cleavages. As Nepal institutes federalism, the ability to formulate security policies aligned with its strategic autonomy interests while managing internal and external expectations will be tested.\nHistorical precedents and enduring geographic realities alongside political changes mean Nepal must craft sophisticated policies. Understanding the regional dynamics and domestic vulnerabilities is crucial to analysing the continuum of Nepal\u2019s national security policy in a complex neighbourhood environment.\nAs a small state, Nepal\u2019s ability to independently formulate security policies has been profoundly impacted by the geopolitical dynamics of its surrounding region. Regional political environments greatly influence how small states manoeuvre about more powerful neighbours.\nVulnerable Nepal\n\nSince King Prithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s rule, Nepal has tried balancing relations between dominant regional forces while occupying a precarious position. Nepal has faced pressing security concerns from both China and India regarding issues like its open borders, Tibetan refugee populations undermining China\u2019s interests, and the earlier Khampa resistance movement against China\u2019s occupation of Tibet.\nSuch incidents highlighted the risks of intervention in Nepal\u2019s affairs. As scholars have noted, India\u2019s annexation of Sikkim in 1975 also carried indirect warnings, highlighting potential territorial sovereignty threats. These types of regional pressures and risks of meddling have challenged Nepali autonomy throughout history.\nFurthermore, Nepal\u2019s high economic dependence on India, such as for fuel and goods, leverages unwelcome outside influence over its decision-making. The 1989 and 2015 Indian economic blockades when displeased with Nepal both violated its sovereign interests.\nLacking self-sufficient military power or economic development compared to its massive neighbours, Nepal cannot avoid reckoning with their security calculations regarding its policies and alignments. As the saying goes, \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place,\u201d Nepal\u2019s national security policy options have been squeezed between Indian and Chinese strategic priorities.\nWhile desiring autonomy, its policies are deeply impacted by external factors it cannot fully control as a small state. The recent National Security Policy tries to map security strategies that protect Nepal\u2019s interests despite its perpetual geopolitical vulnerability.\nNepal\u2019s insecurity has been shaped by its neighbours\u2019 interests, especially India, regarding Nepal and the broader South Asian region. Nepal faces security challenges from both external factors and internal weaknesses.\nExternally, the vast military might of India and China overshadows Nepal\u2019s modest defences. Meanwhile politically, socially and economically, Nepal remains underdeveloped and vulnerable, harming its autonomy prospects. Given such dynamics, Nepal cannot be considered an isolated small state insulated from regional pressures. Neither its geography nor demographics shield it from its neighbourhood\u2019s influential powers. Nepal lacks the military and economic strength rivalling its large neighbours. It has also not capitalised on positive spillovers from the rapid growth of the Indian and Chinese economies.\nThis susceptibility to outside factors impedes Nepal\u2019s independent policy decisions. For example, Nepal and India share an open border that has raised terrorism concerns, with fears that rogue actors could infiltrate India via Nepal.\nThe border areas also sometimes spark tensions between the Indian and Chinese security interests playing out in Nepal. Additionally, when India has previously felt Nepal was shifting allegiances or policies counter to its preferences, punitive actions like the 1989 and 2015 economic blockades have occurred.\nSince Nepal overwhelmingly relies on India for fuel, goods and services, such trade disruptions pose grave economic and security threats. These types of external pressures that directly impact internal stability have long challenged Nepali sovereignty.\nEnduring geographic and political realities means Nepal cannot discount its neighbours\u2019 security priorities regarding its choices. As emerging risks compound and amplify existing historical vulnerabilities, Nepal must craft nuanced national security policies constrained by the strategic calculations of more powerful regional players.\n\nAs Nepal transitions into a federal structure, both long-standing and emerging threats will continue impacting its national security policy deliberations. The new governance model aims to resolve some domestic tensions but also poses risks of instability if ethnic demands are not managed properly during decentralisation.\nMeanwhile, factors beyond Nepal\u2019s control in the region also persist. As India and China\u2019s strategic interests evolve, small states like Nepal must adapt security priorities accordingly. Furthermore, promised economic development from federalism could falter given engrained geographical realities limiting development previously.\nIf prosperity stalls, this could worsen internal security fractures.\nState institutions will need to formulate policies that balance external pressures emanating from two giant neighbours, and themselves both sources of opportunity as well as meddling, with safeguarding security amidst ethnic tensions during Nepal\u2019s delicate federal shift.\u00a0\nThroughout history, Nepal has charted a cautious national security approach constrained by regional power dynamics and domestic volatility as a small state. As the strategic environment changes, Nepal\u2019s policy formula will again be tested.\nBut enduring geographic and political realities ensure Nepal must continue walking a fine line between external forces beyond its control that nonetheless profoundly shape its national security calculations in the context of regional power dynamics while asserting autonomy to the greatest extent possible. There are no easy paths ahead for Nepal to chart, only prudent balancing strategies in its complex positioning to protect citizen security.\n ",

    "86": "\nPhoto by Towfiqu barbhuiya on Unsplash\nIn recent years, especially after the Covid pandemic, Nepal has found itself grappling with a significant challenge in its banking sector and overall economic landscape due to the soaring prices of real estate.\nThis issue is multifaceted, stemming from a combination of speculative buying, the pervasive influence of intermediaries, and inflated transaction values. As a result, the current banking policies on lending and valuation methodologies demand urgent reconsideration to mitigate potential economic instability.\nThe heart of the issue lies in the inflated purchase prices of real estate properties, driven by speculative motives and fueled by intermediaries. Buyers, influenced by inflated valuations presented by agents, often find themselves trapped in a cycle where they cannot resell the property at lower prices, leading to a stagnant market. Concurrently, banks extend financing based on these inflated transaction values, disregarding the actual market worth of the property.\nConsider an imaginary scenario where Kamal, under the guidance of an intermediary, purchases a property from Nilesh in Pokhara for Rs 10 million. Influenced by market hype and misinformation, Kamal secures a loan from a local bank based on this inflated transaction value. However, the actual market worth of the property may only be Rs 7 million, highlighting a glaring disparity between perceived and actual property values.\nThis discrepancy underscores the pressing need for robust valuation methodologies and regulatory interventions to recalibrate the real estate market and mitigate banking risks. \nFile: A view from Thankot on the western outskirt of Kathmandu\nHere are some recommendations:\n\nIncorporate government-set prices: Introducing government-prescribed rates for property transactions can serve as a stabilising force. For instance, if the government sets a price of Rs 7 million for the property purchased by Kamal, banks should base their lending decisions on this predetermined value rather than inflated transaction prices.\nStrengthen valuation practices: Enhancing transparency and accuracy in property valuation is essential. Implementing standardised valuation methodologies, such as comparative market analysis and income approach, can provide a more realistic assessment of property values, mitigating the risk of overvaluation.\nEnhance governance and oversight: Strengthening corporate governance standards within Nepali banks is imperative to mitigate systemic risks. Banks should prioritise transparency, accountability, and prudent risk management practices. Regulatory bodies, particularly the Nepal Rastra Bank, should enforce stricter oversight and impose penalties for non-compliance.\nPromote investor education: Educating borrowers like Kamal and sellers like Nilesh about the risks associated with speculative real estate investments is crucial. Providing access to accurate information and financial literacy programmes can empower individuals to make informed decisions and mitigate exposure to market volatility.\nDiversify investment opportunities: Encouraging investment diversification beyond real estate can help reduce reliance on speculative activities. Promoting investments in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology can foster economic resilience and sustainable growth.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing Nepal\u2019s real estate bubble and banking risks requires a concerted effort to revamp valuation practices, strengthen governance frameworks, and promote prudent investment behaviour.\nBy incorporating government-set prices, enhancing valuation methodologies, bolstering governance standards, and promoting diversified investments, Nepal can navigate away from potential financial crises and foster a more resilient economic future for all stakeholders.\n ",

The then royal government in 2003 decided to close it.\nThe study report highlighted the lack of market management, lack of technology advancement as per the need of time, the power outage issue, overstaffing and the lack of managerial efficiency are among the factors leading to the closure of the factory.\nThe report states the possibility of reusing some factory structures and machinery after maintenance. It also states that the Nepal Army Welfare Fund has sufficient budget to operate the industry, adding that most of the raw materials needed for the factory are available within the country. \nAccording to the report, the factory will have no problem for the market if revived as the Nepal Army is one of the major potential consumers with Nepal Army personnel being likely users of garments to be produced by it.\nThe factory has 8,100 square metres of land under its ownership.\nAs the report states, the revival of the industry is needed to contribute to the national industrial development and to contribute to the gross domestic product, to send a positive message to the world market, to boost national sufficiency, in import replacement and the creation of employment opportunities.\nThe study task force has also proposed the outline for the re-operation of the Hetauda Textile Factory.

    "93": "\nDhalkebar substation\nOn December 22, the Nepal Electricity Authority disconnected power to four factories citing unpaid dues. On December 24, the NEA cut down the power of four more factories escalating the dedicated feeders and trunk lines dispute between the NEA and various factories in the country, drawing attention even from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.\nThe conflict revolves around the back-dated bills issued by NEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising, which aim at boosting profits. Factories across Nepal, however, feel the back-dated bills are unfair and have chosen not to pay the due amount. This, however, has now resulted in the NEA cutting down power which seems to have the support of Prime Minister Dahal.\nLoad shedding for domestic customers ended eight years ago, and for industrial customers, five years ago. However, a persistent controversy has arisen following the NEA\u2019s claim of outstanding amounts from industries that used dedicated feeders and trunk lines during the load-shedding period. The NEA argues that these industries and factories are obligated to pay a premium amount for using electricity during the load-shedding period, while the industries are resisting such payments.\nThe dispute over this issue remains unresolved, primarily due to the strong-handed approach of NEA MD Ghising, especially concerning the dedicated lines. Ghising\u2019s stance and handling of the situation have contributed to the ongoing tension and impasse in resolving the disagreement over premium charges for dedicated feeders and trunk lines.\nIn 2018, NEA wrote to 58 factories telling them to pay the outstanding amount which was Rs 10.14 billion. This, NEA said, accounted for the premium that was not levied on the factories from 2015 onwards.\nHowever, all the industries where the letters were sent had paid the regular bills for that period. After the letter was sent, most factories then refused to pay the premium fee stating how they had been subject to load shedding and how they could not use electricity when they wanted even though they were being provided the dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Now that amount has exceeded Rs 20 billion.\nKulman Ghising, who gained acclaim for ending load shedding, has surprisingly been harsh towards the issue of dedicated feeders and trunk lines. His approach and handling of the matter related to premium charges for dedicated feeders and trunk lines have raised eyebrows and generated disappointment among stakeholders. \nWhat are dedicated feeders and trunk lines?\nRepresentational image: Electricity transmission line \nA dedicated feeder involves the supply of electricity through a separate line directly from a substation. This feeder system ensures continuous power supply even during load shedding by allowing electricity to be provided from an alternative line when one is subject to load shedding. On the other hand, a trunk line delivers electricity from the transmission line to the industry by placing a transformer inside the industry itself.\nIn the past, during periods of load shedding in Nepal, essential services such as important government offices, security-related offices, hospitals, telecommunication towers, etc., received regular electricity supply through dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Additionally, certain factories in key industrial corridors like Biratnagar-Duhabi and Birgunj-Pathalaiya used electricity sourced from these lines. The NEA has provided this service to 298 customers during this period.\nHow did the factories get electricity from the dedicated line?\nRepresentational file: An electricity transmission line\nDue to load shedding, industries using generators lobbied for a government initiative allowing them to purchase dedicated electricity, akin to arrangements for government agencies and hospitals. On October 20, 2013, the NEA, under the leadership of Managing Director Mukesh Kafle, announced in Gorkhapatra that customers could buy electricity from dedicated feeders. The notice specified measures to prevent adverse effects on the general public during prolonged electricity supply to industries, with additional charges for such arrangements.\nOn December 31, 2013, the NEA decided to impose additional charges on electricity supplied through dedicated feeders. To address this matter, a committee was established, chaired by the then Managing Director Manoj Kumar Mishra, to study and recommend charges for customers connected to dedicated feeders. Following the committee\u2019s recommendations, the authority\u2019s board of directors, during its 710th meeting on June 27, 2015, approved the imposition of premium fees. The committee\u2019s report classified electricity feeders into separated feeders with load shedding and dedicated feeders with uninterrupted service. The decision was made to provide continuous 24-hour electricity through dedicated feeders.\nHowever, it appears that there were instances of misconduct during the decision-making process for providing dedicated feeders to factories\nMisconduct 1: A premium tariff was applied without a decision by the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission\nThe Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, akin to the role of the Electricity Regulatory Commission, was responsible for setting electricity tariffs. Tariffs could only be implemented after being established and fixed by the Commission.\nHowever, without setting the fee, the NEA directed subordinate offices on September 1, 2015, to collect the fee accordingly. The communication stated that customers using \u2018Time of Day (TOD)\u2019 metres and receiving continuous 24-hour electricity would be subject to a premium charge.\nOn January 3, 2016, the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission told the NEA that the decision to set the tariff through the board of directors was faulty. This information was also forwarded to the Commission of Abuse of Authority Investigation in Nepal and the National Vigilance Centre. Subsequently, the authority retracted its decision, seeking approval for the new tariff from the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission.\nThe Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission finalised the new tariff on January 13, 2016, with the information published in Gorkhapatra on January 24. Notably, the notice did not address matters related to the trunk line. Despite this, Kulman Ghising personally wrote to certain customers, urging them to pay the fee from July 2015 onwards.\nHowever, Shivam Cements Company challenged the tariff imposition. In response, the Supreme Court ruled that the new tariffs could only be implemented after the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission formally determined them. As per the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the NEA could not collect the premium fee for electricity consumed before January 13, 2016.\nMisconduct 2: How was the bill issued when power had not been provided?\nOn February 23, 2016, the NEA issued a notice announcing the suspension of electricity supply from the dedicated feeder to private sector establishments and industries, excluding government hospitals, educational institutions, or offices. This decision was attributed to a decrease in the water level of rivers. The suspension would persist until a further decision was made by the authorities.\nIndustrialists argued that the supply of dedicated feeders, suspended since February 23, 2016, has not been resumed, leaving them to endure load shedding. Despite this, industrialists express their willingness to pay for a continuous 24-hour supply through the Time of Day (TOD) metre. The matter has led to a dispute regarding whether the NEA has reinstated electricity supply to the dedicated feeders and trunk lines after February 23.\nThe Supreme Court has acknowledged the request to review the case due to the disagreement over whether the NEA has resumed electricity supply to dedicated feeders and trunk lines. The case is currently pending in the Supreme Court.\nNepal Electricity Authority\nMisconduct 3: Overruling the Commission\u2019s decisions\nOn December 19, 2016, the Authority\u2019s Board of Directors approved the \u2018Electricity Tariff Collection Regulations 2016,\u2019 with a specified implementation date of July 16, 2016. This raises questions, as to how could the regulations approved in December could have been implemented six months prior. Such discrepancies suggest potential fraudulent practices by the authority.\nFurthermore, the regulations diverged from the decision made by the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission on June 30, 2016. The commission had decided that in cases of load shedding for six hours or more, customers receiving continuous electricity supply from a separate trunk line for 20 hours or more would be categorised as dedicated.\nHowever, the regulations altered this decision by removing the term \u201ccustomers who receive power supply \u201924 hours a day\u2019 through a dedicated line or who receive continuous power supply for more than 20 hours a day through a trunk line when there is load shedding for more than six hours a day.\u201d Instead, it introduced the provision that \u201ccustomers who receive power supply through a dedicated and trunk line of the authority\u201d would be charged as per schedule 2.\nThis discrepancy implies that the authority misrepresented the commission\u2019s decision in the regulations, a fraudulent act. Notably, the authority cannot implement a tariff that has not been determined by the commission, and the decision appears to have been made by Executive Director Kulman from the board of directors.\nMisconduct 4: Back-dated sent years later\nThe premium tariff for dedicated and trunk line services was established on January 13, 2016. Notably, government hospitals, educational institutions, government offices, and non-dedicated line establishments were initially exempt from the premium fee. However, this exemption did not extend to dedicated line consumers in industries and certain establishments.\nThe committee, headed by Bhakta Bahadur Pun and appointed by the Nepal Electricity Authority, identified 298 customers using electricity from dedicated and trunk lines. Out of this total, 184 industries were subject to billing based on the dedicated line tariff. Additionally, 50 clients comprised government-level hospitals and community water projects.\nIn February and March of 2019, the NEA took action by consolidating bills for three years, stating that 58 customers failed to remit the dedicated line tariff. It is noteworthy that during this period, these industries were already paying the standard tariff applicable at that time.\nIn 2019, Kulman Ghising implemented a simultaneous disconnection for certain factories, spanning from July 2016 to April 2020. Criticism from industrialists arose, claiming that the lack of information regarding their electricity consumption over three years, uncertainty about load shedding status, and the abrupt clearance of old bills seemed unjust. Despite these concerns, premium charges continued to be levied until July 2020.\nMisconduct 5: Wrong tariff imposed\nThe Board of Directors of NEA implemented the Electricity Tariff Collection Regulations in 2016. Under these regulations, a special tariff rate, inclusive of premium charges, had been established for industrial, commercial, and non-commercial customers receiving power supply from dedicated feeders and trunk lines since July 2016.\nIn the event of load shedding, a provision stipulates that a line supplying electricity 24/7 is deemed dedicated. Moreover, a trunk line, consistently powered for 24 hours during a minimum of six hours of load shedding, will incur the same tariff as a dedicated line. To avail themselves of these benefits, customers must apply to the authority, and approval from the Board of Directors is required before accessing these privileges.\nIn sub-regulation (2) of regulation (5), industrial, commercial, and non-commercial customers using the authority\u2019s dedicated and trunk lines must pay monthly service, demand, and energy fees as outlined in schedule 1a.\nMoreover, unless otherwise specified in sub-regulation (5) of regulation (5), customers currently supplied by the trunk line can access power for 20 hours or more, akin to a dedicated feeder, by paying the dedicated feeder tariff. Approval from the Board of Directors is required for such service applications, mirroring the process for a dedicated line.\nIndustries in disputes over dedicated and trunk lines claim they haven\u2019t applied for these connections, lack board approval, and haven\u2019t received continuous electricity for over 20 hours, as per regulations.\nThe authority, however, has failed to furnish evidence detailing the process by which it connected lines to industries lacking the proper authorization to consume electricity from dedicated feeders or trunk lines.\nAdditionally, the same regulation increased fees for ordinary customers, a rate the authority has collected since July 16, 2016.\nMisconduct 6: NEA hiding TOD data\nThe regulation states that taxes must be levied based on the readings of the TOD (Time of Day) metre, and the total TOD data is closely monitored. Even if the process mentioned by the regulatory framework is not fully implemented, industries have expressed their readiness to pay the premium tariff if the TOD metre consistently shows an electrical consumption exceeding 20 hours per day during electricity cut-off, as revealed by the Authority.\nThe TOD metre used in industries is a smart metre that provides real-time data on which day and for how long electricity has been used by the consumer. In a note sent to factories on September 1, 2015, the Authority directed them to install TOD metres. If electricity is consistently consumed around the clock, NEA said a premium tariff would be enforced, resulting in corresponding charges.\nHowever, a lawyer explains that there is no law stipulating the imposition of a premium rate when the Authority fails to provide a TOD metre to the consumer and the power supply extends for only an hour. Presently, amidst the dispute involving 58 enterprises, only one industrialist has expressed a willingness to comply with the premium tariff.\n\u201cIn terms of procedure, we are prepared to pay if there is a formal request letter for dedicated feeders and trunk lines submitted to the Authority, accompanied by evidence of approval obtained during the authority\u2019s board meeting, and electricity has indeed been supplied at the specified time,\u201d says an industrialist. \nThe Authority has control over this metre and has collected fees from factories based on it. Factories and enterprises involved in the dispute over dedicated and trunk lines said that they are ready to pay the premium fee if TOD shows continuous use of power for more than 20 hours during the electricity power cut.\nKulman Ghising, however, has chosen to shut down the primary electricity lines of the factories instead of providing evidence and information to the industrialists regarding TOD. The industrialists, willing to adhere to the billing procedure, question why Ghising is not collecting the fee by presenting the available facts and evidence, especially when the relevant data is within Ghising\u2019s office.\nNEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising\nMisconduct 7: The process of bill exemption was not followed, and forced actions taken\nIn Regulation number 20 of the Authority\u2019s Electricity Distribution Regulations, it is stipulated that in the case of a billing discount for a customer, approval from the authorised officer, as outlined in Schedule 29, is required for discount billing.\nAs per Schedule 29, the designated officials with the right to make decisions concerning bill exemptions are specified. According to this schedule, the office chief has the authority to make decisions up to Rs 2,000 at once, office chiefs ranging from 8 to 9 up to Rs 5,000, regional chiefs up to Rs 50,000, the director-general up to Rs 100,000, and chief administrative officers can make decisions exceeding Rs 100,000 concerning bill exemptions in a single instance.\nHowever, an exception is made for Ghising himself, granting him the right to decide on bill exemptions exceeding Rs 100,000. Despite this authorisation, he has not personally made any decisions regarding bill exemptions. Notably, Ghising had sent the bill without making any decision before disconnecting the electricity supply for an outstanding amount exceeding Rs 1 million.\nThe provision in the Electricity Distribution Regulations asserts that if a customer surpasses the specified time for electricity usage, bypasses scheduled power cut hours, and engages in unauthorized use of electricity, the authority has the power to disconnect the line under the Theft Control Act, 2001, Section 9. Additionally, fines and compensation can be imposed according to Section 11. However, the authority has not demonstrated interest in recovering the amount through this process. This provision has been in effect since February 23, 2016, for electricity power cuts.\nMisconduct 8: Even after the end of the industrial power cut, why did NEA continue to charge the dedicated fee?\nThe Nepal Electricity Authority had declared the total discontinuation of power cuts in Nepal starting from May 14, 2018. Despite this announcement, Kulman implemented billing adjustments for February to April 2017, a period during which the Authority itself had officially ended power cuts. Moreover, the Authority continued billing, inclusive of the premium charge, until the fiscal year 2020/21.\nDespite the recommendations from the Study Committee led by the then Energy Secretary Dinesh Ghimire, advising against imposing additional charges on industries for the period preceding the determination of electricity tariff by the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission and after the cessation of power cuts by the Authority, both of these suggestions were disregarded by the Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission. The Cabinet endorsed the committee\u2019s report on August 3, 2020; however, its implementation has not been executed thus far.\nWhy is Kulman Ghising not budging?\nAccording to the decision of the Nepal Electricity Authority\u2019s Executive Committee, legal experts suggest that the Authority has the option to disengage from the matter of incorrectly issued bills. In line with the resolution of the 108th meeting of the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, if electricity is consumed for more than 20 hours daily on the TOD metre, a decision has been reached to apply the premium fee. Consequently, if Ghising takes sincere measures, this issue could potentially be resolved conclusively.\nSpecifically, the Managing Director himself is required to make this decision. Yet, the Authority\u2019s management retains the ability to make decisions on this matter since it has already set the electricity tariff. While the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission previously held the responsibility for tariff determination, it now falls under the jurisdiction of the Electricity Regulatory Commission. According to the law, the regulatory commission possesses the authority to address disputes between consumers and service providers.\nExport-oriented industry faces blow\nThe cement industry has been severely impacted by the shutting down of power and the back-dated bills associated with dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Despite being a symbol of self-reliance over the past decade, the industry now faces a crisis, largely attributed to what is perceived as coercive tactics by NEA and Ghising. While Ghising received acclaim for eliminating power cuts and gaining popularity, his actions have had adverse effects on the cement sector. \nIn a departure from principles of justice, the open mistreatment of entrepreneurs by a state entity has occurred without intervention, and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has maintained silence for an extended period, raising concerns about Kulman Ghising\u2019s continued tenure.\n ",

    "95": "\nA terminal of the Pokhara Airport\nThe Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) team requested documents related to the construction of Pokhara Regional International Airport from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) in November 2023. Despite repeated requests, the CAAN\u2019s director general, Pradeep Adhikari, hesitated to submit the requested documents. Frustrated, the CIAA even called him to its office asking for an explanation.\nIn the presence of the DIG, also the head of the police division; the head of the CIAA, Prem Kumar Rai, asked Adhikari to provide the required documents. \n\u201cIf you do not cooperate, we will use other means to get the documents,\u201d Rai told Adhikari.\nDuring the discussion, a source indicated that when Rai suggested an alternative method to obtain the documents, Adhikari gestured towards the head of the police division. It was at that moment that the CAAN provided the documents and details of the Pokhara Airport construction process.\nThere has been speculation of corruption while building the Pokhara Airport. Some even argue that this is the biggest corruption case ever in Nepal.\u00a0\nTo understand whether the speculation was right, Onlinekhabar spoke to an auditor from the Office of the Auditor General, an engineer who worked on the Pokhara Airport project, and a technician from the CIAA who remained anonymous. All three sources agree that the level of irregularities observed during the construction of the airport might be the most significant thus far.\nCost saving and its impact on Pokhara Airport\nFile: Construction works begin for the Pokhara International Airport, in Kaski district, on Wednesday, August 2, 2017. Photo courtesy: Rabindra Adhikari/Twitter\nAs per the agreement between CAAN and China CAMC Engineering Company Limited, the airport was required to be filled with soil and gravel sourced from a distance of five kilometres. This would elevate the airport\u2019s height slightly compared to its current level.\nHowever, the Chinese company used soil and gravel from the immediate vicinity for construction purposes, rather than transporting it from a distance of five kilometres as stipulated. Interestingly, the Chinese company allocated USD 80 million for transportation costs but did not stick to the specified requirement, thereby saving a significant amount.\nAs a result of this, the runway of Pokhara Airport has been adversely affected. As the airport\u2019s height is lower than planned, Nepal will bear the price of this oversight over the long run.\nThe report prepared by the Auditor General\u2019s office last year indicated that aircraft are required to pass at a height of 40 kilometres from the east of Chhine Danda, rather than the originally planned 30 kilometres, due to the low elevation of the runway.\nAccording to sources from the CIAA involved in the investigation of the Pokhara Airport, this disparity has led to increased costs and necessitates the removal of the water tank built in that area. Furthermore, there is a situation where aircraft must take off with a reduced load compared to their actual capacity.\nThis deviation from the agreed-upon plan has resulted in the Chinese company making millions of dollars while Nepal has incurred long-term losses. The General Accountant noted in their report, \u201cGiven that the raw materials (stones, soil, and gravel) which builders are obligated to source from a distance of 5 kilometres involve royalty payments, the implications for external procurement and transportation costs for businesses should be thoroughly analysed.\u201d\nBudget and discretionary payments\nThe CAAN gave the contract to a Chinese company on the EPC model. According to a CIAA engineer, under this model, once the contract is awarded, the authority is responsible for providing all information regarding engineering design, material procurement, and construction to the relevant construction company. However, any additional services provided by the construction company cannot be reimbursed.\nHowever, an additional payment of Rs 2 billion has been made based on the bill of quantity (BoQ) sent by the Chinese company to CAAN. According to the details received by Onlinekhabar, the money was released even though the consultants had pointed out to CAAN that it would be wrong to make such a payment.\nThe Office of the Auditor General has also followed the matter of exemptions. The responsibility for payment for beautification, including taxes and fees, falls on the agency that secured the contract. However, the auditor general\u2019s report mentions that the Civil Rights Authority of Pokhara managed to secure an exemption of Rs 2.22 billion by listing the project on the master list.\nApart from this, a question has also been raised about the selection of Nepali consultants. From the budget perspective, a Korean consultancy company was appointed for the construction of Bhairahawa Airport, which is half the size of Pokhara Airport. However, in Pokhara, a Nepali consultancy company called ERMC was appointed without international competition, and the payment was made based on its decision.\nAccording to a technician at CAAN, the standard procedure involves submitting documents, including reports prepared by the contractor company, to the consultancy for approval initially. This approval is granted only after a thorough study and on-site inspection of the report. Subsequently, the approved documents are forwarded to CAAN. It was decided that CAAN would also adopt this process to liaise with the contractor, thereby reducing the consultant\u2019s role to a secondary one.\n\u201cThe consultant\u2019s role was diminished as CAAN continued to deal directly with the contractor, and the contractor directly with CAAN. This type of arrangement is not common in such large construction contracts,\u201d said an engineer working at CAAN on the condition of anonymity.\nThe burden of the foreign exchange rate on Nepal\nPhoto by Kenny Eliason on Unsplash\nAccording to the details mentioned in the agreement made in 2016, the exchange rate of the US dollar was Rs 82. Payments and transactions had to be made by fixing the exchange rate on the day of the contract. However, later the payment was made according to the exchange rate of the day of the transaction.\nAs of today, certain airport works remain unfinished, and payments are being made based on the current exchange rate, which stands at Rs 132 per US dollar. A source from CAAN mentioned that due to the exchange rate fluctuations at the time of payment following bill submission, there has been a significant loss incurred during the transaction.\nAccording to the contract agreement for the construction of the airport, the contractor (Chinese company) was bound to appoint a consultant. However, it failed to fulfil this responsibility but still claimed expenses for it. CAAN itself ended up appointing a consultant. CIAA sources revealed that when the exchange rate fluctuated, the payment amount increased by approximately 65 per cent.\nIt is not impossible to alter the rate of certain tasks after the contract has been agreed upon. However, the rationale and justification for such adjustments must be thoroughly confirmed. It must be acknowledged that if the lowest bidder wins the contract during the competition, subsequently increasing the rate may not be unfair to the other party.\n\u201cIf there is a question about new issues and rates, the consultant and the representative of the CAAN should sit down and resolve it but it has been done abruptly,\u201d said a CAAN source.\nQuestion on quality\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal inaugurates the Pokhara Regional International Airport, Nepal\u2019s third international airport, in Pokhara, on Sunday, January 1, 2023.

A soil test report, a prerequisite for the construction of the structure, was missing. Additionally, certain building and structure designs were not provided by the contractor company to the consultant as required.\nCIAA spokesperson Nara Hari Ghimire said that the investigation of the complaint about the construction of Pokhara Airport is ongoing. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the in-depth details of the investigation but we can assure that the investigation is ongoing,\u201d says Ghimire.\nAccording to a technician from CAAN, the drainage system was constructed without considering the rainfall rate in Pokhara. Additionally, he mentioned that the foundation required for the terminal building was not excavated. Besides these significant issues, he highlighted various other irregularities related to quality testing that have not been addressed and should be separately accounted for.\nThe CIAA is conducting an investigation into Pradeep Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), based on allegations of illegal wealth acquisition. Despite repeated attempts by Onlinekhabar to contact CAAN officials through various channels, they have declined to respond or provide comment.\nThe unsustainable airport\nAircraft lands at Pokhara Regional International Airport\nPokhara Aiport has seen five international flights so far and all of them were chartered flights. Due to the presence of Chine Danda near the airport, wide-body aircraft are currently unable to take off or land. A retired pilot from the Nepal Airlines Corporation has indicated that the height of the runway and the hill are mismatched, necessitating wide-body aircraft to reduce their maximum take-off weight to operate safely.\nOn March 21, 2016, a loan agreement was signed between the Government of Nepal and China. The agreement stipulated a total loan amount of Chinese Yuan 1.37 billion, out of which Chinese Yuan 355.9 million constituted an interest-free loan. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) is responsible for repaying the remaining amount, including interest, in instalments by the year 2036.\nAccording to the exchange rate at the time of the agreement, the total loan amount of Chinese Yuan 1.37 billion would equate to approximately Rs 22.61 billion. Out of this sum, Rs 5.83 billion represents interest that does not need to be repaid. Nepal is obligated to pay Rs 800.4 million annually to the Chinese Exim Bank solely for interest. Within two and a half months of the agreement, Nepal received a loan with interest to be repaid within 20 years.\nThe construction of Pokhara Airport, based on political consensus, indicates a shared agreement within the country regarding corruption in major projects. Economist Swarnim Wagle says, \u201cIncreasing the cost to a large extent and showing some reduction in the progress of the Pokhara airport construction project is intentional. This cannot be achieved without political help.\u201d\nAmid the chaos of geopolitics\nNepal\u2019s new Pokhara airport might fall prey to India-China tussle. Onlinekhabar graphics\nThe technicians who worked at the Pokhara Airport said that there had been a political setting for corruption even before the construction started. After its construction, this airport, which is said to be a project of national pride, has become a victim of geopolitical interests.\nAfter the second People\u2019s Movement, the government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to conduct a feasibility study for building an international airport in Pokhara. According to an employee familiar with the developments at that time, the government intended to secure a loan from ADB and assume responsibility for the feasibility study to construct a second international airport in Pokhara following Kathmandu.\nThe conclusion of the feasibility study team contradicted the government\u2019s plan regarding the construction of an international airport in Pokhara. The study team\u2019s report highlighted that operating an airport in Pokhara would pose significant financial and technical challenges. \nThe complications of the international airport operation in Pokhara were mentioned point by point as per Ishwari Prasad Paudyal who represented the then Ministry of Physical Planning and Infrastructure in the meeting (called to present the conclusion of the feasibility of Pokhara Airport) under the leadership of the Ministry of Tourism. The main thing among them was that it was not feasible financially to establish an international airport in Pokhara.\n\u201cThe report mentioned the airport did not make sense financially. With no agreement signed with India regarding the air routes, the airport did not make sense,\u201d says Paudyal. \u201cSecondly, everyone wants to come to Kathmandu and no foreign airline company will agree to go to Pokhara.\u201d\nThe feasibility study report involving representatives of the ADB office and CAAN also pointed out the geographical location as a challenge for the operation of an international airport in Pokhara. \n\u201cIt would be technically difficult to land an aircraft due to the hills around Pokhara,\u201d said Paudyal, \u201cThe government was asking for a soft loan from ADB but it disagreed showing that it was not feasible, which is written in the meeting\u2019s minutes.\u201dADB concluded that if the loan was invested mainly in Pokhara Airport, it would not be recovered. With that, it withdrew from the construction of Pokhara Airport.\nAccording to security sources, regardless of ADB\u2019s findings, Pokhara is a business and tourist centre of choice for the Chinese as it is a strategically important place connecting Tibet to China through the Korla border. The tourist city Pokhara, where the Tibetan refugee centre is located, also comes under the interest of Western countries. Hence, China intended to build an international airport in Pokhara to increase its influence.\nFor that, the Chinese initially began fostering a favourable environment for airport construction by deepening relations with parties such as the UML and later the Nepali Congress, which were ideologically aligned with them. All major political parties in Nepal agreed to construct an international airport in Pokhara, hoping that a significant development project would garner publicity and yield financial benefits.\nNepal renewed the air agreement with India in 2009 as an attempt to find a solution to the ADB\u2019s conclusion influenced by geopolitical issues also with technical issues. According to the agreement, it was agreed that apart from Kathmandu, Indian airlines will also be allowed to land at airports outside the capital.\nIn the agreement, it was agreed that Indian airlines would be allowed to land at Pokhara, Nepalgunj, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Bhairahawa and Dhangadhi. Similarly, India agreed to provide facilities for Nepali airlines to fly to airports including New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.\nEncouraged by the air service agreement signed by the then Minister of Tourism Sarat Singh Bhandari and his Indian counterpart SM Krishna, Nepal proceeded with the process of airport construction agreement to strengthen Chinese interest. \nIn 2014, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) reached an agreement with China CAMC Engineering for the construction of the airport, despite recommendations from experts of the Asian Development Bank advising against it.\nAccording to the agreement, in 2016, the government of Nepal and the China Exim Bank agreed to provide a loan of USD 216 million for the construction of the airport, and the Chinese company CAMC would undertake the construction of the Pokhara airport as a \u2018turnkey project\u2018.\nAccording to the agreement between the two countries, the design, procurement and construction of the Pokhara Airport with a 45-metre wide and 2,500-metre long runway had to be completed and handed over to Nepal. Since the airport was built with Chinese loans, it was conditioned that only Chinese companies could compete.\nAccording to the conditions, China CAMC Engineering Company was selected out of the nine that applied, while IPPR, which was developed as its sister organisation, was selected as the main consultant company. ERMC was appointed as a consultant on behalf of CAAN.\nAccording to an engineer who worked there, both the consulting companies were appointed only to approve the work of China CAMC Engineering Company, which got the contract for the construction of the airport.\n\u201cAmong these two companies, the Chinese company was not qualified to work as an independent consultant, while the Nepali company was not capable of working as a consultant in such a large project,\u201d said the engineer.\nAfter the agreement, in April 2016, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal laid the foundation stone of the airport to complete the construction work in July 2021. Due to the Covid pandemic, the construction work was affected. The project had to wait until January 2023 to be inaugurated.\nWith the inauguration of the Pokhara Airport, there was widespread anticipation that the air traffic pressure on Kathmandu would reduce and Pokhara would establish connections with international cities. Buddha Air, a private sector airline company in Nepal, had devised plans to commence flights from Pokhara to Varanasi and gradually expand services to other cities in India. Corresponding proposals were submitted to India in this regard. However, India did not approve the air plan to link Indian cities with the airport constructed with Chinese investment.\nAs indicated in the ADB report, commercial international flights have been unable to land in Pokhara due to India\u2019s refusal to permit the use of the air route. Even if India were to allow the use of the air route, there remains a technical hurdle regarding the ability to land and operate large aircraft at full capacity. To facilitate the operation of the airport, which is situated three kilometres east of the old domestic airport, the CAAN itself has undertaken the task of cutting an 817-metre-high hill, thereby enabling large aircraft to land.\nAccording to sources, alongside negotiations regarding the air service agreement, India sought to gain management control over Tribhuvan International Airport. However, due to Nepal\u2019s security concerns and reluctance to entrust airport management to an Indian company, India withdrew its commitment to granting Nepal an air route.\nHolding on to the BRI statement\n\nDuring the inauguration of the airport on January 1, 2023, Chen Song, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, expressed through social media that Pokhara Airport is an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious development concept of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nNepal promptly denied Ambassador Song\u2019s statement. However, Song\u2019s statement contradicts the genuine intent of assisting in the operation of the airport and instead has been utilised as propaganda material by India and Western countries, insinuating that China built Pokhara Airport for strategic purposes.\nTaking a policy of not even buying electricity produced by Chinese companies in Nepal, India has not allowed any aircraft to travel from the Chinese-invested airport to the Indian airport. After China explained it as a BRI project from the public forum, pretending to have achieved great success by building an airport with Chinese investment in Pokhara, the southern neighbour has become more irritated towards Nepal in aviation matters.\nAnalysts say that this has caused more complications in the operation of Pokhara Airport. \n\u201cWe are falling into the trap of geopolitics. China will be dissatisfied if all three airports are given to the Indian group, India occupies a large part of the market given to China\u2019, analyst Chandra Dev Bhatt says, \u201cWe have not been able to balance the other stakeholders including the two neighbours.\u201d\nHowever, the Chinese side does not want to back down from the statement that the airport is under the BRI project. On June 21, 2023, when a Sichuan Airlines aircraft landed, the Chinese ambassador, who came to Pokhara, repeated his old stance during a short interview.\n\u201cEven if it is difficult for Nepal to accept that the Pokhara Airport was built under the BRI project, for China this is primarily a BRI connectivity project,\u201d he said.\nThe Chinese ambassador\u2019s statement has placed Nepal in an even more delicate situation. Currently, India has not granted flight permissions to Pokhara Airport, constructed with Chinese investment, and Gautam Buddha Airport in Bhairahawa, built by a Chinese company, as per the pre-construction agreements. It has been over a year since commercial flights commenced.\nCurrently, India has not granted flight permission to Pokhara Airport, constructed with Chinese investment, and Gautam Buddha Airport in Bhairahawa, built by a Chinese company, as per the pre-construction agreement. It has been over a year since commercial flights have commenced.\nIt has already been five months since the Prime Minister visited China and despite the commitment in the joint statement, no Chinese airlines have operated commercial flights to Pokhara. Neither has any Nepali airline company started international air service from Pokhara. Since the Pokhara Airport, which is stuck in the geopolitics of China and India, is not operational, the Nepali airline companies that are waiting for the expansion of air services are also stuck.\n\u201cFrom the day the airport was inaugurated, we had planned to start Varanasi-Pokhara flights twice a week and increase the flight frequency to Dehradun and Delhi as well,\u201d Buddha Air spokesperson Dipendra Kumar Karn said. \u201cAccording to that plan, we had sent a proposal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. However, we have not received permission yet.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s eye on Nepali airports\nSimilar to Pokhara Airport, which was built with Chinese investment, the Bhairahawa Airport near the Nepal-India border, funded by the ADB, has not achieved the expected success. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has publicly expressed plans for operating three international airports under the public-private partnership concept, along with the construction of the controversial Nijgadh Airport.\nAccording to authoritative sources, there is regular dialogue between the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority, Pradeep Adhikari, and Prime Minister Dahal as part of the same plan. However, Adhikari, who leads the project to advance the construction process of Pokhara Airport, is currently under investigation for financial irregularities during the construction of both the Bhairahawa Airport and CAAN headquarters.\nAdhikari, himself under investigation for allegations of amassing wealth, claims that the Indian company Adani Group, led by Gautam Adani, is seeking to operate Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Bhairahawa airports under a public-private partnership, as well as to construct the Nijgadh airport.\nAccording to Jagannath Niraula, spokesperson of the authority, a proposal to advance the operation of the constructed international airport and the construction of the Nijgadh Airport through public-private partnership has already been prepared by CAAN and sent to the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation. Subsequently, the cabinet has formed a study committee to determine the course of action regarding public-private partnerships and legal arrangements, Niraula said.\nA committee member expressed confidence that the committee, mandated to submit a report within 45 days, will recommend the operation and construction of the airport to the Indian company.\n\u201cConsidering the current situation, it seems unlikely for any company other than Indian companies to operate the airport, as India does not grant permission to use its airspace,\u201d the member added.\n ",

    "99": "\nThe widespread use of free and unauthorised VPN in Nepal raises concerns about data privacy and security. Representational image VPN. Photo: VPN\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) use has increased exponentially since the TikTok ban in Nepal. With the use of VPNs in Nepal increasing, many questions have arisen about what VPN is, how it works, and its effects on online security and privacy. VPNs used as a safety and security tool all over the world have misconceptions and misunderstandings in Nepal. Here we will try to understand what a VPN is, how it works, the advantages and disadvantages of using a VPN, misconceptions and the use of VPNs in Nepal. \nWhat is a VPN?\nVPNs, or virtual private networks, are technologies that allow secure communication over the public internet by extending a user\u2019s workplace network to their home network securely, all while keeping their browsing activities, identity and location hidden. It does this by establishing a private connection between the computer of the user and a remotely placed server owned by the provider of VPNs. This encrypts as well as hides data to ensure the privacy and security of an individual\u2019s IP address. This is more important especially when using public Wi-Fi since it prevents eavesdropping and protects sensitive information. By creating a secure tunnel from your device to the VPN server, VPNs provide anonymity and protect against scrutiny by ISPs or other intermediaries.\n\nTypes of VPN\nIn general terms, there are three types of VPNs which cater to different needs. \n\nRemote-Access VPN: Individual users can utilize remote-access VPNs to connect to a private network over the internet in a secure way. These are necessary for remote workers and IT support staff who need to access company resources even when they are not physically at the firm\u2019s premises; some examples of this are PureDome and OpenVPN Access Server.\n\n\nSite-to-site VPNs: These VPNs establish connections between different remote networks over the internet, typically used by enterprises to unify various branches into one intranet. This makes it easier for businesses with multiple sites or branches within their business structure to share information and communicate better. A good example of such providers includes NordLayer.\n\n\nClient-to-Provider VPN: These VPNs allow users to gain a direct connection to the internet through their operative VPN firms without any involvement with their own ISPs. Here data is protected from a computer or a phone device until it reaches a user\u2019s provider via virtual private network (VPN). Commercial services such as NordVPN, Surfshark and Atlas VPN are some popular examples of companies providing this service.\n\nStats on VPN\nThe surge in the use of VPNs in Nepal came after the Government put a complete ban on the most popular social media platform TikTok. Even though there was use of VPN in Nepal before that, the numbers were quite on the lower side since most people were not aware of what VPN was and why it was used. We cannot exactly determine how many people use VPN in Nepal to access the internet because of the excessive use of free and unauthorized VPNs. \nVPN usage by region. Photo: Top10VPN\nIn the global market according to Top10VPN, there are over 1.5 billion users worldwide as of 2024. This growth is driven by several reasons including growing privacy and security concerns online, the emergence of remote workers and the need to evade geo-restrictions for content access. Globally the VPN market is around USD 44.6 billion. \nHowever, VPN adoption rates vary across regions with Qatar having the highest adoption rate (69.87 per cent) followed closely by UAE at 61.7 per cent. VPNs are widely used for personal and business purposes such that currently 93 per cent of organisations use them to secure their networks, especially during Covid pandemic when more people work remotely. The VPN market is expected to hit USD 87.1 billion by 2027 due to continued online privacy and security demand. \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of using a VPN\nLike every tool, there are advantages and disadvantages to using a VPN. Even though VPNs are generally a safety tool, there are instances and cases where VPNs do have disadvantages. \n\nAdvantages of using VPN\n\nBetter online security: To protect personal information, data can be shielded from hackers and cyber threats by encrypting internet connections through VPNs.\nImproved privacy- hides identity: The IP address is hidden while the activities taking place on your computer are scrambled hence ISPs advertisers or any third party cannot monitor what you do online.\nIt helps to overcome internet restrictions: Restrictions imposed by censorship or geo-blocks can be avoided by using a VPN allowing you to access restricted content and websites regardless of your location.\nNo more Throttling of bandwidth: With the use of a VPN, internet service providers (ISPs) are unable to intentionally slow down your internet connection based on your online habits hence consistent and uninterrupted browsing speeds at all times.\nSafe file sharing with complete anonymity: Anonymity over one\u2019s identity is guaranteed when engaging in P2P file sharing through a VPN which ensures privacy security and protection against potential legal consequences.\n\nDisadvantages of using VPN\n\nVPNs may affect your internet connection speed: As a result of the data encryption process and the fact that it goes through many other VPN servers, you might suffer from reduced browsing speeds, especially if you are using untrustworthy services.\nGood VPNs come at a cost: Although reliable VPNs have strong security features and fast performance, they usually require some sort of payment which not everyone can afford.\nSlow speed and free VPNs can collect your data: Many free VPN services often lack sufficient security or may even compromise your online safety by logging, storing, and then selling your personal information to third parties.\nSome countries prohibit VPN usage: In certain countries where the use of VPNs is illegal or strictly regulated, individuals may face legal consequences for employing them to avoid internet censorship as well as gain entry into restricted areas.\nBypass local content accessibility restrictions: While one reason for using a VPN is to access content that is blocked in one\u2019s country, numerous online platforms actively discourage any form of such service thus limiting the reachability of region-specific streaming content or certain websites.\n\nLegality of using VPN\nNepal does not have any specific rules over the use of VPN in Nepal. However, the Government has strictly asked the citizens to not use free VPNs and DNS systems to access banned or any other illegal sites. With the increasing risk of cyber threats and cybercrime, the use of VPN in Nepal has addressed the significant need for cyber laws and protection. \nMost countries all over the world do not have any restrictions on the use of VPNs except 19 countries. Some countries such as Egypt, Uganda and China have put in place VPN restrictions to target those citizens who try to evade censorship by the government or access blocked information. \nThese restrictions may involve penalties, imprisonment or even complete bans on VPN technology like in Belarus and Russia. However, VPN enforcement varies with some providers finding ways to bypass these restrictions which shows the continuous struggle between governments fighting for control over the internet space and individuals seeking online freedom and privacy. \n\nWith the increasing use of VPNs, there is still a need for proper rules and regulations in the use of VPNs. Even though VPNs are a safety and security measure, they are also a way to do crime. The same goes for the use of VPN in Nepal. Most Nepali people are completely unaware of the legality of using free and unauthorized VPNs. These can lead to data breaches and identity theft even while using VPNs. Nepal Police and Cyber Bureau have requested people to not use these free services. \nMisconceptions about VPN\nVPN is mostly about making people have more secrecy and safety on the internet, not for doing illegal acts even though it can be used for such a purpose. However, some countries have laws that prohibit VPNs due to their stringent regulations on censorship. Although they use encryption and mask IPs, these networks do not provide absolute anonymity because the providers may still retain users\u2019 information. On the other hand, free VPNs that lack features and have unreliable speeds are at times very tempting but have a negative turn in terms of security and privacy. \nIn addition, VPNs could cause slow internet access speeds or fail to bypass geo-restrictions as well as protect against all types of cyber threats. To ensure strong privacy and computer security on public Wi-Fi, it\u2019s essential to use a user-friendly VPN amid various misconceptions.\n\nVPNs can be illegal: Some countries ban VPNs due to censorship laws.\nVPNs don\u2019t make you completely anonymous: VPN providers can still access user information.\nFree VPNs aren\u2019t as good as paid ones: Free VPNs might compromise privacy, lack features, and have slower speeds.\nVPNs do not always speed up your internet: Encryption and server distance can slow down your connection, although they might prevent ISP throttling.\nVPNs can bypass some geo-restrictions: While most can get around geographical blocks, some sites may detect and block VPN connections.\n\nUse of VPN in Nepal\nTikTok is said to be the main reason behind the surge in VPN use in Nepal. Soon after the government banned TikTok on November 13, the effects of slow internet became evident. People with no prior knowledge began searching for and using free VPNs and DNS systems to access TikTok. This prompted the Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA), Nepal Police, and Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to issue notices advising against the use of free VPNs in Nepal.\nWith the use of these free and unauthorised VPN in Nepal, the risk of data leaks and breaches, hacking, fraud, malware, privacy breaches and money laundering increased at a very high rate. Most free VPNs depend on selling consumer data as a source of income, thereby leading users to disclose private information to third parties. Furthermore, such services may lack adequate encryption and other critical security features that would expose users to cyber crimes. With already a huge data leak back in 2022 of about 25 million users, the risk was evident in the case of VPN in Nepal too. \nPhoto: Unsplash/ Solen Feyissa\nEven though VPNs are a safety feature and use of them is suggested, free VPNs are not recommended by anyone. The government has taken the action of banning TikTok for several reasons. It is still highly suggested to use paid and legit VPN services to protect yourself in the internet world. Paid VPNs such as NordVPN and SurfShark VPN are recommended. However, using banned apps such as TikTok even though paid VPNs and services are still prohibited in Nepal. \nPeople in Nepal need to be aware of using VPN in Nepal on what and where it can be used. VPN in Nepal had been a hot topic for a long time which caused many problems and misinformation to be spread. There has to be a proper explanation of where and how to use VPN in Nepal. With months passing by, there are still many people using free VPN in Nepal to access banned apps and services. \nIn summary, the surge in the use of VPN in Nepal, particularly following the TikTok ban, highlights the importance of online privacy and security. However, the widespread use of free and unauthorised VPN in Nepal raises concerns about data privacy and security. As individuals increasingly turn to using VPN in Nepal for online anonymity and access to restricted content, there is a pressing need for proper education and regulation to ensure the safe and responsible use of VPN in Nepal.\n ",

Photo: Nepal Literature Festival \nPokhara, February 27\nOn February 19, singer-songwriter Bipul Chettri took the stage in Lakeside, Pokhara to loud cheers from the audience. Chettri, along with Bipul Chettri and the Travelling Band, were performing during the 11th edition of the Nepal Literature Festival. The cheers got louder with each successive rendition of the Chettri\u2019s hits like Wildfire, Syndicate, Asaar, Siriri and Mountain High.\nThe band delivered a tight and flawless performance. Hundreds of the audience were gathered to witness Chettri live in concert, which was perhaps one of the most anticipated shows in the entire festival. And undoubtedly, the wait proved to be worthwhile. \nThe band, which performed for almost two hours, did not hit a single wrong note or encounter any errors. Their confidence and energy on stage showcased the high level of musical understanding among the band members. Each member was clear about what they needed to do and how during the performance. The way they covered the stage and engaged the audience in every song, encouraging them to clap and sing along, added life to the concert. The crowd repeatedly called for an encore during songs like Syndicate, Wildfire, and Aashish. However, due to the strict schedule, the band couldn\u2019t comply.\nBesides Chettri\u2019s songwriting skills and the melodies he puts in his songs, he is also loved for his stage performance. His aura and performance captivate the audience in such a way and people who have watched him before come back wanting more. \nAlthough Chettri has performed hundreds of live concerts in different parts of the world, he still feels highly strung before the performance, and the concert during the Nepal Literature Festivals was no exception. For Chettri, the live concert is something that he reckons is one of the most beautiful aspects of music.\n\u201cDespite having years of experience, I go through mixed feelings of nervousness and excitement before every performance,\u201d Chettri says. \u201cI think such feelings will never disappear.\u201d\nThe worries about whether the sound will be good and if the crowd will enjoy the performance pose such feelings to Chettri. But the mood changes after he sees how the crowd responds to him after performing a couple of songs, and when the audience begins participating in those songs, his nervousness disappears to a greater extent.\u00a0\n\u201cTo some extent, the nervousness exists till the last song,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cBut, the relaxed and satisfied feelings after the good show is a thing that keeps driving me to do more and more shows.\u201d\nBecoming a superstar\nBipul Chettri and the Travelling Band. Photo: Facebook/Bipul Chettri \nIt has been a long time since Bipul Chettri did his first stage show. \n\u201cI was in grade 3 when I first took the stage,\u201d he says. \u201cMy music teacher pushed me to get up and sing.\u201d\nThe push along with a small pep talk then helped him get on stage to sing Bob Marley\u2019s Buffalo Soldier. He did that for fun but little did he know he would one day become a household name in northeast India and Nepal.\n\u201cMy father was an inspiration too. The way he put his heart into music pushed me to become a musician myself,\u201d he says.\nChettri\u2019s first professional live concert took place in 2015 in Calm Restaurant, Kathmandu, after releasing his debut album Sketches of Darjeeling in 2014. The success of the debut album not only gave him a name and fame but also opened an avenue to form a band and do live shows.\u00a0\n\u201cAfter releasing Sketches of Darjeeling, considering its growing popularity, I started getting a lot of calls for the live shows, and the situation compelled me to form a band,\u201d says Chettri.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince Bipul Chettri did not have a band back then, he called Pranaya Gurung, who currently plays guitar in his band, and told him that he needed to form a band as soon as possible. Afterwards, the duo started looking for suitable musicians and formed a band.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhile selecting the members we looked for someone who had musicianship and musicality. These two things were our main priority,\u201d says Chettri.\nEvolution of live shows\n\n\n\nA lot has changed since then. The stage\u2019s setting, lights, sound and the crowd everything has changed. And with that, Bipul Chettri and The Travelling Band have changed the way they perform too.\nThe live show of Bipul Chettri and The Travelling Band is flawless and worth watching not merely because they have good songs but also due to their continuous practice and dedication to ensuring their performance is top-notch every time.\u00a0\n\u201cWe practice at least once a week,\u201d says Chettri. \u201cIf the concerts are approaching, we practice even more.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChettri further says that they practice to polish their muscle memory and sometimes even to recall songs.\nBipul Chettri and the Travelling Band \u2014 which features Prince Nepali on sarangi, Pranaya Gurung on guitar, Rahul Rai on bass, Aman Rathore on drums, Shivam Kharel on keys, Binaya Amatya on sound engineering and Sonam Tasi on band management \u2014 has done numerous of national and international tours. However, Chettri does not find much of a difference in performing in different venues and countries. \n\u201cEverything is the same, the difference is just the place.\u201d\nRegarding performing live in Nepal he says the country has a lovely vibe which is why he loves coming back over and over again.\n\u201cOur music has a good fan base in Nepal. Since our songs are Nepali, we find ourselves more relevant in Nepal,\u201d he says.\nChettri believes that live performances are more than just presentations to an audience; he sees them as the ultimate achievement for musicians. He argues that singing solely in the controlled environment of a studio is insufficient to fulfil the role of a true performer. According to him, the genuine assessment of a performer\u2019s abilities occurs on stage.\n\u201cStudio work has its own beauty; it is an important creative process. However everyone, with the help of technology, can sing in the studio but singing in live shows is a different thing; it is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d says Chettri.\u00a0\nBipul Chettri Photo: Instagram/ Bipul Chettri \nSo far, Chettri has released three albums, Sketches of Darjeeling in 2014, Maya in 2016 and Samaya in 2021. This means Chettri has an elaborate list of songs, making it challenging to choose which ones to include in the setlist. \nThe band\u2019s selection process for the setlist considers various factors such as the timing of the performance, the audience\u2019s mood, the ambience of the venue, and the other bands scheduled to perform. Despite the numerous options, there is one song that Chettri is adamant about including in the setlist: Wildfire, the song that marked the beginning of Chettri\u2019s professional singing career.\nWhile being asked about his future, he replied, \u201cJust music and more music.\u201d\nChettri believes that music is infinite. \u201cThe more you do, the more you live.\u201d\n\u201cMusic is the best drug,\u201d he concludes.\n ",

    "107": "\n\nAn IPO, or Initial Public Offering, marks the initial instance when a private company introduces its shares to the public, enabling both individuals and institutional investors to acquire ownership stakes. Businesses opt for an IPO to secure funds for various objectives such as expanding operations, reducing debt, or fulfilling other corporate needs. Additionally, it facilitates liquidity for current shareholders.\nIn the primary market, there are three main types:\nThe sequence is typically IPO first, followed by FPO, and then the issuance of rights shares. It is important to note that this structure indicates a buy-only market. If you want to share or trade the IPOs you will need to enter the secondary market.\nHow does a company go public?\n\nA company going public or undergoing an Initial Public Offering (IPO) marks the first time it offers its shares to the public. This allows both individual and institutional investors to become shareholders. Companies seeking to go public must disclose comprehensive financial information in a prospectus including income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and risk factors.\nInvestment banks typically serve as underwriters (usually banking organisations), assisting the company in determining the IPO price, marketing the shares, and managing the overall offering process. The company often raises extra capital to fund the IPO process.\nInvesting in IPOs comes with inherent risks. Investors should thoroughly assess the company\u2019s business model, financial health, competitive landscape, and other relevant factors before deciding to participate.\nWhy do companies go public?\nCompanies may decide to go public for various reasons. One key motivation is the ability to raise additional capital by offering shares to the public. The generated funds can be utilised to expand the business, facilitate acquisitions through share conversions, diversify ownership, support research and development, or settle outstanding debts.\nOpting for a public offering is often considered a reasonable choice compared to alternative capital-raising avenues such as relying on venture capitalists, private investors, or securing bank loans. Going public can also provide a significant amount of publicity, enhancing the company\u2019s visibility.\nMoreover, becoming a public company may enable favourable terms from lenders, as the increased transparency resulting from regular audits and public reports instils confidence. However, it\u2019s important to note that this transparency comes with significant costs, including legal, accounting, and marketing expenses, many of which are ongoing.\nAdditionally, public companies may enjoy more favourable credit borrowing terms compared to private entities. Nevertheless, the process of going public may introduce complexities, such as diversifying ownership, imposing restrictions on management, and subjecting the company to regulatory constraints.\nWhat do you need to apply for IPOs?\n\nTo fulfil the requirements for filling IPOs, follow these steps:\n\nEnsure you have a bank account (savings). You will have to fill up the form for the particular bank.\nSelect a Depository Participant (DP) registered with the CDSC.

    "115": "\nPhoto by Maxim Hopman on Unsplash\nShares and IPOs have been a rave in the Nepali market for a couple of years now. It seems that everyone is trying to enter the market and get a footing. The share market, also known as the stock market, is a dynamic financial platform where the buying and selling of securities such as stocks and bonds take place. However, not everyone is quite literate about the share market and what goes inside.\u00a0\nBefore venturing into the share market, it is critical to familiarise oneself with the essential terms and concepts that govern this complex financial arena. Understanding the terms is crucial for making informed investment decisions. \nSo here are a few of the key terms that one should know and understand to thrive in the share market.\nIndex\n\nAn index serves as a statistical gauge that encapsulates the performance of a designated group of stocks. Its primary function is to monitor and reflect the overall performance of a specific market or a particular segment within the market, providing investors and analysts with valuable insights into market trends. Examples of widely recognised indices are the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq. NEPSE (or Nepal Stock Exchange Index) is the one for Nepal.\nStocks\nA stock or share denotes ownership in a corporation, signifying that the shareholder possesses a stake in the company and holds a claim to its assets and profits. This ownership may come with voting privileges and the potential to receive dividends.\u00a0\nStocks come in two main types: common and preferred, each carrying distinct rights and associated risks. Common stock is the most prevalent form of equity ownership in a company. Preferred stock, on the other hand, grants shareholders a different set of privileges and often comes with a fixed dividend rate, providing a more stable income stream.\u00a0\nTicker Symbol\nPhoto by Oren Elbaz on Unsplash\nA stock ticker symbol is a distinct combination of letters assigned to a security for identification purposes on a stock exchange. Typically consisting of letters, these symbols play a crucial role in streamlining the stock trading process. It serves as a unique identifier for individual stocks, facilitating swift identification and trading by investors. For instance, the ticker symbol for Agricultural Development Bank Limited is ADBL and Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Ltd is UPPER.\nBull Market\n\nOne of the most common things said about the share market is whether it is a bear or a bull. A bull market is defined by an upward trend in stock prices, accompanied by a prevailing sense of optimism and positive investor sentiment. This phase is often linked with economic expansion and heightened confidence in the financial markets. Investors tend to exhibit a greater willingness to purchase and retain stocks during this period, with the expectation that prices will experience further growth.\nBear Market\n\nMeanwhile, a bear market is identified by a substantial decline in stock prices, accompanied by widespread pessimism and a prevailing negative sentiment among investors. Typically, it involves a drop of 20 per cent or more from recent market peaks, prompting investors to adopt a more risk-averse stance, resulting in increased selling pressure. In essence, being bearish denotes adopting a pessimistic viewpoint towards the overall market or specific stocks, anticipating a downward trend in prices.\nInitial Public Offering (IPO)\nAnd the most popular term known and used by a layman is IPO; their entryway into the share market. So what is an IPO?\nAn IPO marks the inaugural issuance of a company\u2019s shares to the general public. This strategic financial move serves a dual purpose by enabling the company to secure additional capital for its expansion plans through the issuance of new shares, while concurrently presenting potential investors with the chance to acquire ownership stakes in the newly public entity. In essence, an IPO signifies the initiation of public trading for a company\u2019s stock, facilitating a crucial avenue for both fundraising and investor participation.\nPortfolio\nAn investment portfolio refers to the assembly of financial assets owned by either an individual or an institution. The primary objective of constructing a portfolio is to effectively manage risk through the strategic allocation of investments across various asset classes.\u00a0\nFor one to get a better hold of their assets and the market it is advised that they diversify their portfolio. Diversification involves the inclusion of a mix of assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other financial instruments, within the portfolio. It aims to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in any single asset category on the overall portfolio, by spreading investments across different types of assets.\nRepresentational file\nMarket Capitalization (Market Cap)\nMarket Capitalization is a financial metric that represents the total value of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of stock. This valuation is determined by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. Essentially, market cap serves as a comprehensive indicator of a company. By assessing market cap, investors can classify companies into distinct categories such as the relative size and scale of different companies within the market.\nMarket order\nA market order is a directive to buy or sell security promptly at the prevailing market price, ensuring swift execution. However, the actual execution price may differ from the expected price. This type of order guarantees quick completion but lacks specificity regarding the price. It is often mixed and confused with limit order.\nA limit order, in contrast, is an instruction to buy or sell a security at a designated price or a more favourable one. Unlike market orders, limit orders prioritise a specified price point and may not guarantee immediate execution. This type of order is commonly employed for stocks with high liquidity.\nBroker\nA broker, whether an individual or a registered firm authorised by regulatory authorities, plays a crucial role in facilitating the purchase and sale of financial securities on behalf of clients. This involves the execution of trades on stock exchanges, with brokers earning compensation in the form of commissions or fees for their services.\u00a0\nTheir primary function is to streamline the process of securities transactions, ensuring efficient and compliant dealings in the financial markets. There are a fixed number of brokers, authorised for trading.\nVolume\nTrading volume signifies the quantity of shares exchanged within a specified timeframe. Elevated volume typically signals robust investor engagement and market liquidity, denoting active trading. Conversely, low volume may indicate reduced market activity, pointing to a more subdued trading environment.\u00a0\nThe trading volume and the fluctuations also refer to the volatility of the market. High volatility implies substantial price fluctuations, reflecting dynamic market conditions and potential opportunities for significant gains or losses. On the other hand, low volatility suggests a more stable market environment with relatively modest price movements, which may appeal to investors seeking a calmer and less turbulent trading experience.\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E Ratio)\nThe Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) is a financial metric that compares a company\u2019s share price to its earnings per share (EPS). This widely utilised valuation measure offers insights into the market\u2019s assessment of a company\u2019s profitability. In essence, the P/E ratio reflects the amount investors are willing to invest for every dollar of earnings generated by the company. It is calculated by dividing the company\u2019s share price by its earnings per share, providing a key indicator of investor sentiment and the perceived value of the company\u2019s earnings.\n ",

    "124": "\n\nInvestors and new traders in Nepal have been receiving fines for failing to transfer shares on time. Those who have been fined have been claiming they do not have an idea of how to transfer shares to the person who has bought them. Additionally, some investors have been penalised with fines exceeding the profits made from selling the shares.\nThe most recent example of this is investors being required to pay Rs 27 million within just six months, between July 2023 and January 2024, as reported by CDS and Clearing.\nSuch a penalty is referred to as a closeout penalty. According to the data from CDS, investors paid a closeout penalty of Rs 9.3 million in December/January alone. In the last fiscal year 2022/23, investors paid over Rs 40 million as a closeout penalty. Considering the growth rate of the current year, it appears that the penalty amount will increase compared to last year.\nThreshold\nInvestors now buy and sell shares through the Trade Management System (TMS) from the comfort of their homes.\nAfter selling shares through this system, the shares must be transferred by the next day. Upon transferring the shares, they are deducted from the Demat account of the seller, while the buyer receives the shares in their Demat account.\nFollowing the sale of shares, the broker company sends a message to the investor\u2019s phones, indicating that WACC and EDIS, confirm that the sale of the shares will be conducted. After that, if the transfer is not completed by the following day, the broker company requests via email and phone.\u00a0\nHowever, those who sell shares but do not transfer them must pay a penalty of 20 per cent of the same amount as the shares sold for closeout. A total of 25 per cent of the fine goes to the government, and the rest goes to the person buying the share.\nSo for instance, if the shares are sold for Rs 100,000 and not transferred, then the person selling the shares has to pay a penalty of Rs 20,000. The government will then take 25 per cent of that amount (Rs 5,000), while the remaining Rs 15,000 will be received by the person who did not receive the purchased shares.\nIf the shares are transferred on time, there is no need to pay a 20 per cent penalty.\u00a0\nOnce the shares are sold, a message will be sent to the mobile phone, and only upon receipt of this message can the shares be transferred from Meroshare. Occasionally, there are also issues with the Meroshare online system. If there is a technical problem, some leeway is provided during the share transfer process.\nKnow the rules\nPhoto by Nimisha Mekala on Unsplash\nPurna Prasad Acharya, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CDS & Clearing, says that investors should first be aware to avoid the closeout penalty.\n\u201cAfter entering the stock market, investors should be aware of this matter. They cannot excuse themselves by saying that they do not know the process of selling shares or the process to be completed after selling,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBroker companies should also inform everyone who comes to open an account about the process.\u201d\nCurrently, the person who buys the shares automatically receives them in the account, but the person who sells them has to transfer them. He mentioned that determining the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the shares and the holding period of the shares is essential for capital gains tax calculation.\u00a0\nAcharya stated that due to structural complications related to the act, law, and share calculation, the automatic transfer process cannot be executed after the sale of shares.\nIf the shares are sold and not transferred, the buyer does not receive them. In the failure to obtain the shares, the buyer can visit the broker\u2019s office and claim compensation for the amount. The broker company will impose a penalty on the party who fails to transfer the shares and use this penalty amount as compensation for the party who did not receive the shares.\nAccording to Krishan Giri, Chairman of Sun Securities, both new and old investors face closeout penalties. \u201cAfter selling shares to new investors, they are unaware that they need to transfer their shares from the online system, and as a result, they incur fines,\u201d said Giri. \u201cEspecially those who sell IPOs are penalised if they fail to transfer. They assume that there will be an automatic transfer after selling the shares.\nBoth new and existing investors have been fined. \u201cEspecially during the book closure period (lasting 3 to 7 days), EDIS is not generated. Investors fail to understand that EDIS is unavailable during this time,\u201d Giri explained. \u201cHowever, after the book closure, EDIS becomes active. Investors should initiate transfers at that point. If they still fail to do so, they will incur a closeout penalty.\u201d\nHow to transfer shares?\nWACC represents the average cost of a company\u2019s shares. So, the first step after selling the shares and before you transfer shares is to determine the WACC. Following the WACC calculation, the average cost per share of purchasing shares with broker commission is computed.\nOnce the WACC is determined, the shareholding duration is established. Shareholders holding shares for more than a year (365 days) are subject to a capital gains tax of only 5 per cent, whereas those holding for less than a year are taxed at 7.5 per cent.\nFor this reason, the system automatically indicates the days of shareholding. Subsequently, the shares are transferred through EDIS.\nCalculating WACC\nTo calculate the WACC, initially, the shareholder must log in to Meroshare via their Demat account and navigate to \u2018My Purchase Source\u2019 to identify the shares they have sold.\nOnce the shares are identified, they will be listed based on the date and method of acquisition. A checkbox is provided on the left-hand side to select each share. Each checkbox must be selected. After this, the purchase price of the company is recorded. If there are any adjustments to be made to the recorded price, changes can be made accordingly.\nAfter making such changes, the rationale for altering the purchase price should be explained in the right-hand remark space.

Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale\nStudent politics and movement hold utmost position in world politics. It has played a crucial part in almost every revolution throughout the globe. Their advocacy for participatory democracy, economic justice and social harmony is admirable. \nThe foundation of various political and social changes was laid by students. Starting from The American Revolution to The Global Climate Strikes, the student movement has contributed a lot to the development of the modern world. The Opposition of the Vietnam War, The White Rose Movement against Nazi and the Demonstration on Tiananmen Square show the bravery of students and their commitment to democracy and freedom.\nIn Nepal\u2019s context, students and their unions played a pivotal role in every big political change that the country witnessed. Starting from the Anti-Rana Rebellion (1950s) to the changes of 1990 and 2006, none would have been possible without the active participation of students and their sacrifices. A decade-long People\u2019s War of Nepal brought immense social and political transformation in the history of the nation, which was also powered up by the students. In short, the student movement stood up as the backbone of social movement in the history of our country. But today they seem to lose their spark in every step. \nStudent unions who used to set the directives for political parties regarding social issues and even claimed autonomy from the mother political parties are blamed for turning into mere tools to serve the partisan interest of mother political parties. Their undemocratic structures and lack of transparency of union leaders in their work have also declined the attraction of the general public and common students towards the movements. The movement which used to be called a nursery for national politics that helps to raise new and young political leaders for the nation is under the big question today. The relevance of student unions and movements is under threat. Can we answer all the questions raised towards us? Can we revive the student movement?\nThe challenges are massive and the questions ahead are very tough. Even though there are challenges, we can find out the mitigations too. The honest initiation by the young generation can restore the glory of the student movement. As Mao says, \u2018Make yourself the first target of the revolution\u2019, we must be ready for self-transformation. \nThe way of student leaders who are leading the movement must change their thinking and working mechanisms. The student leaders should maintain their credibility, transparency, and accountability towards the general public and students. This shall lay the foundation for reviving of student movement. There are many ways and ideas to raise the foundation of the student movement. However, in this article, I will focus on these three prime responsibilities.\nConnecting with society\nPolice obstruct students from staging a play against the House dissolution, in Kathmandu, on Monday, February 15, 2021. Photo: Aryan Dhimal\nThe students are considered to be the progressive block of the society. They should not advocate the pre-set agenda of society and run behind the propaganda set by others. The major responsibility of students and their union is to understand the real social dynamics of the new transition that the nation is going through and the factors responsible for them. They should also be able to counter the problems brought by changing social dynamics through their intellectual intervention and suggest the way ahead.\nCountries cannot move ahead without understanding the actual change in their socio dynamics and also the resistance and adaptation to those changes. Student unions should be the first to understand those changes and act responsive. In today\u2019s context, Nepali society is going through several alternations which are not still serious issues of discussion for mainstream politics. \nIssues like Movement of Identity, Changing Family Structure, Globalized Monopoly of Financial Institutes, Socio-Economic Aspects of Local and Abroad Migration and many others that are affecting the life of the general public should be carried out, analysed and advocated by the student unions. Student unions must stand firmly on the issues every issue related to the livelihood of the general public and stay connected to laymen rather than engaging themselves with so-called established big leaders. This helps to build trust and hope in student unions.\nStudent movement itself is an opposition movement and is a part of social movement. Thus, it should dare to raise questions against the ruler irrespective of who represents the government and shall always be a trustworthy partner of society, more especially of subaltern communities.\nStudent-based student movement\nFile: The front side of Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex of Nepal\nPolitically we might feel proud of our historical achievements but as a general student, there is very little for which they can appreciate us. Issues of students became a corner part of the movement, only political agendas dominated the space for decades due to the transition faced by the nation. But now it is time to make a historical call for political and organizational independence from partisan affiliation and declaration of new dynamics of the student movement that holds students first.\nToday student unions are limited up to the agitation against petroleum price hikes and unrestrained debate against each other. No considerable attempts are being made to facilitate students and reform the existing educational system. Academic calendars are disturbed, curricula set by our universities are uncompetitive globally and there are high dropout rates. There is quality diversity between rural and urban areas and even between different institutions and universities. Besides this, we do not provide learning with earning opportunities nor job guarantees after degrees to students, thus students are under the burden of debt today due to which they cannot continue further. \nUniversities lack full-time students due to which there is no research output. There is also a serious problem of student-drain, the rising dominance of foreign universities affiliated institutes is also challenging our education system. It is time to change our discourse on the student movement and discuss problems like the above which are affecting the lives of students and questioning our education system.\nStudent organisations now should advocate for the overall reform of the education system and all sorts of rights that students deserve but are deprived of. A minimum support program for students (MSPS) can be the theme of the movement which will advocate subsidies for students on food and accommodation and educational materials, part-time job opportunities and special grants for their research interests. Besides this, we shall also be aware of day-to-day problems faced by them like irregularities of calendars, fee hikes and many more. Joint advocacy of regular election of Free Student Union irrespective of partisan interest is most important and must even guarantee that regular students dominate the election. In short, the student movement should dare to return itself to real students rather than bowing down to party leaders.\nStructural transformation of unions\nStudent unions portray them as the guard of democracy and freedom but they have minimum internal democracy. They do not have a parallel leadership structure and are highly hierarchical. The central committee of unions are directly connected to respective party headquarters, and thus could not enjoy their autonomy. \nThe issues and movement of unions are controlled by party committees. Central committees are bounded by party committees and they bound the committees below them. Committees of campus are mobilised by the centre when needed but their autonomy is sized even if the issue is related to their respective campus. This pattern has moved real students away from being part of student unions. Student unions are near to the partisan interest of the respective party and far away from the interest of fellow students. Most of the so-called leaders of all the unions are not even students.\nBeing part of a student union myself, I have realised that a real student can never lead the union due to the bulky structural format we have built. Even if one never fails, it takes 18-20 years for him/her to complete the journey from a member to the central leader of the union. This process will decline the passion of individuals to work for students and the education system, rather they are directed to use their position as a ladder for party politics. Besides this, nepotism and favouritism are other problems inside the student unions. Our unions\u2019 internal divisions are still traditional. Departments of unions are the copies of their respective party which are useless. There is no innovation neither those departments can contribute any.\nThus, the structural transformation of the student union is one of the prominent aspects that shall be considered and it is simple too. Granting autonomy to student unions and all respective committees, along with dismantling hierarchical structures and establishing a new pattern that enables genuine student leadership in organizing and movements, is sufficient.\nHistory itself speaks about the necessity of the student movement in Nepal. Today\u2019s dynamics also appeal for the strong representation of the student union and new wave of student movement to clear the existing disturbances of the society. But our present status doesn\u2019t allow us to lead this society but there is neither an option. \nA transformed student movement is the demand of the time and we should lead this nation in all aspects; philosophically, politically and organisationally. Let us first stand for the students and students shall stand for this nation. Nation is of all but mostly is of us. Let us commit, we can revive again; the essence of the student movement again.\n ",

    "130": "\nPreeti Rai celebrates after scoring a last-minute winner against Lebanon in the semi-final of the WAFF Women\u2019s Championship.\nThe Nepali women\u2019s football team has probably never been discussed as much in Nepal as they have over the past week. The Nepali women\u2019s football team, which recently finished as runners-up in the WAFF Women\u2019s Championship, were even given a hero\u2019s welcome. They were celebrated like no other team as the entire nation watched the women punch above their weight and compete with the best in the world.\nThe final against Jordan was watched by Nepalis all over the world with the match peaking at 400,000 views at one point. Despite losing agonisingly on penalties, the women were hailed heroes in Nepal who narrowly missed out against the defending champions and West Asian powerhouse Jordan.\nWhile the Nepali women\u2019s football team has not yet clinched a title after almost four decades of international play, there remains a sense of optimism surrounding women\u2019s football in the country. This optimism stems from the evident promise and potential demonstrated by the players.\nBest is yet to come\nNepali players celebrate a last minute penalty against Jordan in the final of the WAFF Championship. \nCaptain Anjila Tumbapo Subba, who returned to India to play in the Indian Women\u2019s League after leading Nepal in the WAFF Championship, said that despite the heartbreaking loss in the final, the team had come back more resilient and determined.\n\u201cWe narrowly missed out on our first title but we showed how strong we are as we refused to give up even in the final moments of the match against Jordan,\u201d said Subba.\nDespite the optimism shown by Subba, this was Nepal\u2019s 11th loss in the final of a major tournament. Since the team was formed in 1986, it has lost five times in the SAFF Championship, three times in the South Asian Games, Hero Gold Cup, Nadezda Gold Cup and the WAFF Women\u2019s Championship.\nWhile the team did face adversity once again, the women showcased remarkable resilience and performance in Saudi Arabia, earning commendation and applause. Despite facing challenges, they demonstrated a fighting spirit that deserves recognition.\nDespite the limited preparation time, Nepal exhibited a dogged style of play. Their journey to the final, marked by easy victories in all three group-stage matches and a comeback win against Lebanon in the semi-finals, showed how much they wanted to get over the line.\nIn the final against Jordan, the defending champions and tournament favourites, Nepal put up a formidable fight. Despite taking the lead in the first half, Nepal could not hold on to it. Soon the team were staring down the barrel of another final loss as Jordan scored two second-half goals, including one late on. But the team did not give up and scored a clutch penalty to take the game to a shootout.\nLuck, however, was not on Nepal\u2019s side as they lost the final. Despite that, the women showed their potential and determination.\nIf you take away the shootout, the Nepali women\u2019s football team had an amazing tournament. Sabitra Bhandari, Nepal\u2019s superstar football, was superb scoring nine goals in four matches. However, due to her club commitments, she had to return to France. Her absence undoubtedly left a hole in the team. It is natural to speculate that with Bhandari\u2019s presence, the result might have been different for Nepal. However, in football, there are no \u2018ifs\u2019 and \u2018buts\u2019. The reality is that she was not available for the final match and Nepal lost.\nThe players, however, can be proud of themselves. They were able to do all this with nothing but sheer will. The All Nepal Football Association has not been able to conduct domestic football tournaments for over two years. This has meant many women have had to go to India to fulfil their passion.\nDespite all this, the team still played their best as they promised to come back stronger than ever.\nWomen\u2019s football team\u2019s message to Nepal\nNepal women\u2019s team with their runners-up medal. \nThe women\u2019s football team has shown how much potential they have. Despite internal disputes and challenges weakening Nepali football, their performance has infused hope and optimism among Nepali fans.\nSubba, the team\u2019s captain, has called on the government and ANFA to prioritize Nepali women\u2019s football as she believes that could be the defining factor in the team winning something big in the future. With several women footballers playing in women\u2019s leagues across the world, the team feels it has what it takes to reach the next level.\n\u201cIf they invest in us, we can do even better,\u201d she says.\nAmong the 23 players in the Nepali team, six are currently participating in the Indian Women\u2019s League. In addition to Subba, defender Geeta Rana plays for Sethu FC in India. Likewise, Preeti Rai and Deepa Shahi play for Kickstart FC, while Amrita Jaihi and Rashmi Kumari Ghising play for Sports Odisha. Subba and Rana have gone to India to join the team while the others are in Nepal.\nSimilarly, Bhandari now plays for France\u2019s En Avant Guingamp and marked her return to the team with her debut with a goal against Lille.\nThis shows that Nepali players possess the capability to excel not only domestically but also on international platforms. \nNeed for investment and games\n\nDespite the limited resources, zero investment, and a lack of domestic football infrastructure, Nepali women\u2019s footballers have gained recognition through their performances on the field.\nNow, the players and the fans are calling on ANFA to help these women get to the next step. As the women returned, calls were initiated for a women\u2019s football league, establishing grassroots programs and academies starting from the women\u2019s age groups is crucial for the long-term development of the sport.\nANFA has recently unveiled its annual calendar for 2024-25, which includes only three programs for women\u2019s senior and junior categories. Notably, the calendar outlines a plan for a women\u2019s football league competition to be conducted in two stages. The competition is slated to commence in March, with the final stage scheduled for July. While this initiative is a step in the right direction, further efforts and resources are needed to fully support and promote women\u2019s football in Nepal.\nThe U18 Women\u2019s Youth League is scheduled to be held in November, while the U-14 School Tournament (Girls) is scheduled to be held in May-June.\nAdditionally, on the international front, the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) will host the U16 SAFF Women\u2019s Championship as part of its regular program. Notably, Nepal is set to host the SAFF U-16 Championship. Meanwhile, Nepal\u2019s participation in the SAFF U-19 Championship took place in Bangladesh.\nFurthermore, the ANFA has earmarked a date for a friendly match involving the women\u2019s football team. However, the specific opponent and location for this match have yet to be determined.\n ",
    "131": "\nPhoto by Nimisha Mekala on Unsplash\nThe stock market brings many financial opportunities. It is one of the few avenues that helps people generate wealth. This holds true in Nepal where there are limited sectors available for people to diversify their wealth.\nSince the Covid pandemic, many people have gotten into Nepal\u2019s stock market. During the pandemic, NEPSE introduced online trading and made it accessible to all as people recognised its profit-making opportunities, initiating a surge of interest and participation. However, many did so without proper knowledge or information.\nThis has led to many losing their hard-earned money as the stock market has gone down significantly over the past two years. To ensure this does not happen, people need to learn the basics of the stock market, acquaint themselves with terminology, and only then start trading.\nSo if you are just stepping into the stock market, here are some of the essential things that you must understand before you start.\nTrading Account\nA trading account is an essential tool for individuals looking to participate in the stock market. When a trader in Nepal decides to invest in the stock market, they would approach a licensed brokerage firm. This account is typically opened with a brokerage firm licensed by the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE).\u00a0\nThe purpose of a trading account is to enable individuals to buy and sell stocks listed on the NEPSE, typically offering real-time updates on the status of the account, including available funds, current holdings, and transaction history. For a trading account, the account balance is a crucial aspect of a trader\u2019s financial position in Nepal\u2019s stock market. It represents the total amount of money in the trading account at a given point in time. \nBroker/Brokerage\nPhoto by Oren Elbaz on Unsplash\nA brokerage, in the context of finance and investing, refers to an individual or a firm that facilitates the buying and selling of financial assets on behalf of clients, who are typically investors or traders. The primary role of a broker is to act as an intermediary, connecting buyers and sellers in financial markets. In the Nepali context, brokers are typically enlisted with the entities registered with the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE).\u00a0There are 88 brokers in Nepal.\nFor traders in Nepal, selecting the right brokerage platform is crucial for executing trades efficiently. This involves considering factors such as licenses, fees, and customer support. It is also important to note that different brokers may have diverse fee structures. By carefully evaluating these aspects, traders can make informed decisions that match their financial objectives and preferences within the trading environment.\nPortfolio management\nWhen it comes to investment, a long-term investor usually focuses on a mix of stocks and bonds to balance risk and return. Since an investor has diverse stocks, portfolio management becomes crucial.\nInvestors usually have diverse financial goals, such as wealth creation, capital preservation, or generating income. To do this, one will need to understand the economic climate and tailor the portfolios accordingly. Portfolio management involves the strategic planning and oversight of a collection of investments to achieve specific financial objectives.\u00a0\nIndicators\u00a0\nTechnical indicators are tools used by traders and analysts to analyse historical price data and identify potential trends or reversals in the financial markets. Moving Averages (MA) is one of the key terms to understand but it has many different subtypes that impact trading decisions. They are calculated by averaging a set of past prices over a specified period. They are used to smooth out fluctuations in price data and provide a clearer view of the overall trend.\nOther Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in trading are measurable metrics that help assess the effectiveness and performance of a trading strategy, portfolio, or individual trades. Other terms to understand are Return on Investment (ROI) which is the percentage gain or loss on an investment relative to its cost to measure the profitability of a trading strategy or investment portfolio. Another is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions\u2013typically ranges from 0 to 100.\nHigh Risk, High Reward\nLike any stock market, NEPSO also experiences fluctuations influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, political stability, and global market trends. In Nepal, like in any other market, the principle of high risk, and high reward applies to various investment opportunities. For example, investing in emerging sectors or small-cap stocks may offer substantial returns, but it comes with higher volatility and uncertainty.\u00a0\nAssessing the risk tolerance of the investment is crucial, considering factors like market stability, regulatory environment, and individual financial goals. Engaging in thorough research and consulting with financial advisors can help investors strike a balance between potential gains and risks in the context of Nepal\u2019s specific market conditions.\u00a0\nBullish/Bearish Market\n\nOne of the most common things said about the stock market is whether it is in a bear or a bull phase. Investors tend to show a greater willingness to purchase and retain stocks in a bullish market, with the expectation that prices will go higher. Whereas in a bearish market where prices of stocks are falling or expected to fall is often characterised by pessimism and low investor confidence.\nWhile bull markets provide opportunities for capital appreciation, and investors may allocate their portfolios to take advantage of favourable market conditions, bear markets highlight the importance of risk management and the need for strategies that can help protect capital during downturns.\nMarket Orders and Limit Orders\nIn fast-paced markets or when the trader prioritises speed of execution, a market order ensures the trade is filled promptly. In trading, you need to know about the market order and the limit order. Market orders are executed immediately at the current market price, while limit orders are set to buy/sell at a specific price or better.\nA market order is a directive to buy or sell security promptly at the prevailing market price, ensuring swift execution. However, the actual execution price may differ from the expected price and one starts trading with the Ask Price is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a security or asset. On the other hand, a limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. It allows traders to set a desired entry or exit point, and the order is executed only when the market reaches or improves upon the specified price.\nCandlestick charts\nPhoto by Maxim Hopman on Unsplash\nIn many markets, candlestick charts are widely used for technical analysis. These charts provide a visual representation of price movements over a specific period, commonly used for daily, weekly, or monthly analysis. Each candlestick on the chart displays the open, closed, high, and low prices for the given time frame. Uptick and downtick refer to small increases or decreases in the price of a security.\u00a0\nTraders use candlestick patterns to identify potential trends, reversals, or continuation patterns in the market. For example, a \u201cbullish\u201d candlestick pattern might indicate a potential upward trend, while a \u201cbearish\u201d pattern could suggest a potential downward trend.\nEntry and Exit\nIn trading, this is the ultimate skill for one to hone\u2013deciding when to enter (buy) and exit (sell) a trade. In this, identifying key support and resistance levels is crucial. Traders may enter a trade when the price reaches a support level, anticipating a bounce, or exit near a resistance level, anticipating a potential reversal. Traders need to align their entry and exit strategies with their overall investment goals, whether focusing on short-term gains or long-term growth.\nEntry and Exit strategies may involve specific price points, technical indicators, or fundamental factors including the ones described above. Analysing candlestick patterns can guide entry decisions. Setting predefined profit targets is a common exit strategy where traders may close a position when the price reaches a specific level, securing profits. Staying informed about regulatory changes in Nepal is essential as it can affect market dynamics and influence entry and exit decisions.\n ",
    "132": "\nPhoto: Pixabay/ Gerd Altmann\nClimate change poses a significant challenge both in the present and the future. While Nepal\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions account for less than 1 per cent of the global total, the impact of climate change on the country is disproportionately severe.\nWith diminishing snowfall in the Himalayas and rising global temperatures, the effects are palpable. But just knowing about climate change issues online is not enough.\u00a0\nInvestments in Nepal often prioritise infrastructure development, post-disaster recovery, and mitigation efforts. While these are undoubtedly crucial, there is a notable gap when it comes to prioritising climate change education. Acknowledging that a joint effort is being made to take the education and importance of climate change and its adaptive measures to the school levels and younger generation.\nThe project aims to equip Nepali students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the challenges of climate change and contribute to a sustainable future.\nThe project has been titled Strengthening a Climate Smart, Green and Resilient Education System in Nepal. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not merely a buzzword but a necessity for communities to thrive amidst changing environmental conditions. This realisation has been eye-opening and has underscored the urgency of action,\u201d says Monica Lama, Focal Point for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) at UNESCO.\nHow the project came to life\n\nThe project\u2019s seeds can be said to have been laid back in 2020 during the Transforming Education Summit which highlighted the urgent need to include climate education in school curricula, with sufficient contextual depth.\nEfforts to address this gap have gained momentum, with discussions initiated last year in collaboration with the Norwegian Embassy. Norway\u2019s early involvement in the Greening Education Partnership paved the way for fruitful exchanges and collaborations.\u00a0\n\u201cThe impact of climate change on education is profound, with access to schools often disrupted by extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. School-going adolescents, particularly in vulnerable communities, face significant challenges due to missing school days and the resultant disruption in their learning,\u201d said Nikita Dhawan, Second Secretary for Gender Equality and Education at the Norwegian Embassy.\nThe prioritisation of education and climate change adaptation is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by environmental degradation and ensuring a sustainable future. \n\u201cThe lack of awareness is widespread, with approximately 90 per cent of surveyed countries, reporting similar gaps in knowledge,\u201d she says.\nShe further says, \u201cReports from organisations like Plan International and UNICEF highlight the urgent need for better preparation and planning to address the climate crisis\u2019s impact on education. A 2021 survey by UNICEF revealed that over 1 billion children worldwide are at risk due to climate change-related hazards.\u201d This, in addition to the internal policy notes, guided them to form this project in Nepal.\nThis first and unique partnership involves the collaboration of UNICEF and UNESCO. It is also one of the unique approaches taken in the South Asian nations. It emphasises the importance of holistic approaches to education. It also includes working closely with the Centre for Education and Human Resource Development (CEHRD) and Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) to seamlessly integrate the projects into the schools, along with the already-active government interventions and initiatives.\n\u201cThe project has already been adopted and recognised by the ministry, signalling a commitment to integrating climate education into the broader education system. The focus is on ensuring that this integration is seamless and effective, avoiding duplication and fragmentation. Moving forward, we will focus on the same,\u201d says CEHRD Director Ganesh Paudel.\nPrakriti Gurung, Science officer & Team Lead for the Natural Science Unit in Nepal at UNESCO, also adds, \u201cCollaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and integration of their expertise and resources, will further enhance our efforts.\u201d\n\u201cOver eight months, a comprehensive framework was developed, centred around four pillars: physical safety of schools, curriculum development, integration with government initiatives, and capacity-building,\u201d she says.\nThe approach\u00a0\nRepresentational image.\nSpeaking on the approach, Lama explains, \u201cDuring the inception phase, starting from December, will focus is on laying the groundwork for effective implementation, ranging from global issues to local and regional contexts. We aim to avoid duplication of resources and ensure optimal utilisation by engaging in thorough discussions to map out policies, curriculum enhancements, and research initiatives. Working closely with the working committee formed by the government will also be crucial here.\u201d\nGurung adds, \u201cWe aim to identify several workable areas, model schools and local municipalities where detailed consultations will be conducted. In selecting model schools, we aim for diversity, including examples from areas outside Kathmandu, particularly in the peripheries and beyond the valley.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of reinventing the wheel, we seek to identify existing successful climate action programmes and strategies and build upon them. By learning from past experiences and leveraging proven methodologies, we can streamline our efforts and maximise impact,\u201d she adds.\nLama also briefed that they will have to take a three-pronged approach to encompass a comprehensive strategy.\nShe says, \u201cFirst is curriculum enhancement. In this, we are collaborating with CDC to expand the curriculum to include climate-related topics in various subjects. Training sessions for textbook writers ensure that relevant content is accurately incorporated. This approach offers flexibility, providing suggestions rather than strict guidelines, and broadens the scope from environmental studies to encompass social sciences.\u201d\n\u201cSecond is teacher training. This we recognised as the need to bolster teachers\u2019 confidence in teaching climate change, specialised training programs and handbooks are being developed. The emphasis is on integrating climate resilience across subjects rather than introducing an additional burden,\u201d she adds.\u00a0\nSo far the project aims to bring a comprehensive five-day module designed to equip educators with the same.\u00a0\nThe third is, she says, \u201cGreening schools initiative that looks at selected schools into model green schools, this initiative extends beyond physical greening to incorporate agricultural practices and cultural knowledge with the school premises.\u201d\nTopics to cover\nRepresentational image\nClimate change is a complex issue that intersects with various fields, including science, economics, politics, sociology, and ethics. Climate change education promotes interdisciplinary learning, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a holistic understanding of the interconnected nature of environmental challenges.\nBy instilling knowledge, values, and skills related to climate change, education contributes to building a more sustainable future for current and future generations. Investing in climate change education is essential for fostering a global culture of environmental stewardship and ensuring the health and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.\nEducation about climate change encourages individuals to make environmentally conscious lifestyle choices, such as reducing energy consumption, minimising waste, conserving water, and supporting eco-friendly products and services. These collective actions can significantly impact reducing carbon footprints and mitigating climate change.\nSchools that have already undergone interventions from various organisations and initiatives demonstrate a heightened awareness of climate change among students and staff. Local authorities are increasingly open to integrating climate education into school curricula, recognising the importance of nurturing climate-resilient communities.\n\u201cGlobal Partnership for Education (GPE) defined activities and progress are focused on promoting clean/green energy through the utilisation of renewable sources and their integration into schools. Additionally, botanical labs are established to facilitate organic farming, contributing to the reduction of the carbon footprint,\u201d adds Medinee Prajapati, environment specialist at CEHRD.\nBut, with this particular project, one of the focus areas will be on integrating climate education from primary to secondary levels, encompassing grades 1 to 10, underscores the comprehensive approach being taken.\nAt the primary level (grades 1 to 3), the curriculum should lay the foundation. As students progress to higher grades, the curriculum can integrate climate-related topics into various subjects such as science, social studies, and language arts. Secondary schools (grades 4 to 10) can further build upon this foundation by encouraging students\u2019 initiative through eco clubs and extracurricular activities, fostering a sense of responsibility and agency.\u00a0\nThe impacts sought\nRepresentational image.\nOne crucial aspect of this preparation is investing in the children. \u201cThey are the future custodians of the planet, and shaping their understanding and habits early on is paramount.\u201d\nPaudel says, \u201cOne example of similar initiatives that can make a difference is the effects Open Defecation Free (ODF) areas where children have understood not to defecate outside, they feel more shy and reserved about it, in comparison.\u201d\nBy instilling eco-conscious habits in children and involving parents and communities in the process, we can create a ripple effect of positive change that extends beyond individual households to benefit the environment, he adds.\nThe upcoming endorsement of a new concept note underscores the commitment to advancing climate education initiatives through strategic collaboration with organisations.\nPaudel gives insights on the impact, \u201cThe scale of impact of this project is indeed significant, with approximately 600,000 individuals, including parents, teachers, and members of the Parents Teachers Association, that can be directly reached out. This presents a tremendous opportunity to create widespread awareness and instil sustainable habits not only within schools but also at diploma levels and other educational projects.\u201d\nThe project, Lama says, is moving forward with a three-year timeline in mind, it is essential to ensure that the initiatives implemented have a lasting impact beyond this period. The updating of greening school guidelines represents a significant step forward in promoting environmental sustainability within the education sector.\u00a0\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant shift in awareness and discourse surrounding climate change in Nepal. The country has shown a vibrant community of youth climate activists who are both active and influential. They say dedication and passion drive positive change, advocating for policies that prioritise sustainability and resilience.\n\u201cThere is a need to produce more climate change advocates and implementors. This involves fostering a culture of environmental stewardship and activism among students and communities. By empowering individuals to become advocates for climate action, we can amplify the impact of our efforts and create a groundswell of support for sustainable practices,\u201d Paudel says.\n\u201cAnd it starts with simple actions like encouraging recycling, reducing energy consumption, and fostering a connection with nature,\u201d Dhawan adds.\nThe goal is to establish 100 green schools annually by 2032, this initiative demonstrates a commitment to scaling up efforts and making greening practices a standard part of school operations. While the initial years may prioritise raising awareness about environmental issues, the latter years should emphasise the development of skills and attitudes that lead to sustainable practices and meaningful decision-making and actions.\n\u201cUltimately, the objective of climate education goes beyond classroom learning. Students should be empowered to implement what they\u2019ve learned in their daily lives and actively engage in climate resilience initiatives and projects. Children are powerful agents of change, and by informing and empowering them, they can inspire awareness and action within their communities.\u201d Gurung restates.\n\u201cHowever, this responsibility doesn\u2019t solely rest on the shoulders of educators or policymakers. Parents and communities play a pivotal role in nurturing environmentally conscious behaviours in children,\u201d Lama concludes.\n ",

    "134": "\nLocals in Mugu looking for herbs in the high hills. Herb picking is a major source of income for the locals of Karnali Province.\nThe Karnali region is a hub for natural herbs and spices. According to the Forest Regulation (First Amendment, 2023), around 300 varieties of herbs are found in the Karnali Province. These herbs are important for the residents of the region who make a living out of plucking them.\nGovernment data states there are 74 root species, 33 bark species, 46 leaf and stem species, 90 flower and stem species, 47 plant species, and 10 gum resin species. To collect and sell these herbs, the locals, however, have to obtain permission from the Division Forest Office. They also need to pay a certain fee to do so.\nAround 3,000 people are involved in the practice. The herbs and spices that at plucked by the locals are exported to India and various other countries through Nepalgunj. According to government data, 4.3 million kilograms of herbs were exported to India and an additional 252,000 kilograms were exported to other countries in fiscal year 2022/23 through the Nepalgunj border crossing.\nHalt in herb picking\n\nThings, however, are not the same as only 700,000 kilograms of herbs have been exported in the first six months of the current fiscal year. This, data states, is 70 per cent less than what was exported in the same period last year.\nIn the districts of Mugu and Humla, the collection and transportation of herbs are currently underway to a limited extent. According to Tanka Prasad Sharma, President of the Jadibuti Association of Nepal (JABAN), the collection of herbs from national forests in all districts of Karnali Province has stopped since July 17, 2023.\nSharma pointed out that due to negligence and disregard shown by the Division Forest Office, Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest, and Environment (Karnali Province), and the Government of Karnali Province, the harvesting of herbs\u2014 a primary source of income for the residents of Karnali Province\u2014has come to a halt.\nSince the Forest Regulations was issued on November 17, 2023, the ministry said that it will initiate the process of collecting and transporting herbs soon after developing a new action plan for all the districts.\u00a0\nAccording to Krishna Kumar BC, the Minister for Industry, Tourism, Forest, and Environment in Karnali Province, there is a looming situation where herb picking activities will be halted unless the Division Forest Offices promptly prepare a new action plan for herb collection and initiate the approval process.\nThe division forest officers are not oblivious to the necessity of formulating and approving a new action plan before the expiration of the five-year one. However, the current predicament has arisen due to the officials\u2019 failure to pay attention to the creation of a new action plan.\nWhen the Government of India banned herb imports from Nepal in 2019, about a dozen herbs, including gooseberries, soap pod, bojo, Jatamansi, and Hadelsun, could not be exported. As a result, approximately 300 tonnes of Jatamansi, 150 tonnes of gooseberries, and around 10 tonnes of soap pods have been stockpiled.\nStoring the herbs for an extended period has led to a decline in their quality. Herbalist Sanjay Jain said that this has caused significant financial losses for businessmen, amounting to millions if not billions. Only the herbs listed as eligible for export in the Plant Quarantine system of India are currently being shipped.\nYet, the export of herbs excluded in India\u2019s notice has also been stopped for four years. That is what has made herbalists unhappy. They feel the lack of efforts from relevant authorities to resume exports is a major problem.\nThe halt in herb exports directly affects the impoverished residents of remote hilly and Himalayan districts, for whom herbs are the main source of income. The lack of a defined government policy has left farmers unable to cultivate herbs in their fields. Consequently, there is a rise in herb destruction in forests. The absence of incentives for herb cultivation among farmers raises concerns about the potential decline in the processes of herb collection and foreign export.\nFacilitating the collection\nFile: A map of the Karnali province\nUntil a decade ago, up to 7,000 metric tonnes of herbs were annually exported to India through Nepalgunj. However, in recent years, the export of herbs has decreased to 4,600 metric tonnes.\u00a0\nRajesh Jain, the former president of the Jadibuti Association of Nepal (JABAN) in Banke, says that the absence of a clear government policy and its effective implementation has hindered the generation of substantial income from herb picking. This is despite the considerable potential for herb cultivation in the mountainous and hilly districts of Nepal.\nFollowing the halt in the export of herbs, the primary commodity exported to India from the Nepalganj border, the trucks that came to Nepal with goods from India have been returning empty. Local businessmen argue that the Nepal government must address the issue of herbal extraction.\nThe Divisional Forest Office is required to create a five-year action plan and get approval from the federal Ministry of Forest and Environment to facilitate the collection and transportation of herbs. Once the plan is approved, the forest office charges revenue and grants permission to residents for herb picking.\nThe halt in herb picking and collection has disrupted the source of income for thousands of impoverished families in this province. According to Sharma, approximately 2,600 metric tonnes of herbs were gathered annually from the national forest area of Karnali Province. He says the people of Karnali earn around Rs 1 billion each year through the collection of herbs from the national forest area.\nHowever, since the start of the current fiscal year, the collection and transportation of herbs have come to a halt in the districts of Karnali Province, including Jumla, Dolpa, Kalikot, Salyan, Jajarkot, and Rukum West. This is attributed to the five-year action plan not being approved.\nCall for urgency\nThe Government of Karnali Province says it has devised and released new forest regulations to enhance the efficacy of protecting and managing forest products, including herbs.\nForest Minister BC stated that the collection and transportation of herbs will commence shortly after formulating a new action plan. However, experts hint that it will require a minimum of two months before the new action plan is both prepared and approved.\nThe budget required for the preparation and approval of the EIA report and action plan has not yet been released from the Division Forest offices. Stating that a budget of Rs 1 million is necessary for the action plan and EIA report, the terms of reference (TOR) were recently approved. The process will commence once the budget is cleared.\nAccording to Tek Bahadur Rawat, Divisional Forest Officer of Jumla, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the forest area earmarked for herb picking or collection must be completed before drafting a new action plan. The process of preparing an action plan typically takes one to one and a half months, following the completion of the prescribed procedures.\nAccording to Bhim Bahadur Bhandari, an herbalist from Jumla, the primary season for herb picking in the Karnali districts is from October to November. Herbs have not been collected this year due to the absence of a new action plan. \nHe informs that even if the new action plan is approved in March/April and green flags the commencement of herb collection and transportation, the main season for herb collection is already over. \u201cSo now, we must wait until October of the next year.\u201d\n ",

    "136": "\nEntrance of the Panauti preserved monument area. Photo: Nasana Bajracharya\nIn April 2001, the Nepal Gazette declared Panauti a protected monument zone, under the Ancient Monument Preservation Act, 2013. By doing so the aim was to back Nepal\u2019s proposal, sent in 1996, to enlist the old Newa town along with landmarks such as the Rosi-Punyamati confluence, the Triveni ghat, Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bramhayani Temple, among others as UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\u201cThere were 15 proposed sites in total,\u201d says conservationist Rabindra Puri. \u201cBut even after two decades, we have not been able to enlist any one of them.\u201d\nNow, after 27 years, things are reaching their final phase. Residents, in collaboration with the government, have recognised the importance of this achievement. They have worked tirelessly to transform their long-standing dream into a reality, bringing Panauti one step closer to being listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe road to an official UNESCO declaration was a lengthy one though. And it is still anticipated that it could take up to two years before the final decision is made as UNESCO will weigh various factors including cultural significance, preservation efforts, and community engagement. So how was all of the possible and what does the future hold for the ancient town of Panauti?\n\u201cEveryone had work hard to make this dream a reality,\u201d says Ram Sharan Bhandari, mayor of Panauti Municipality. \u201cThe restoration work is proceeding diligently. We hope we get to hear the good news soon.\u201d\nPerilous pathway\nTriveni Ghat during the Barhabarse Makar Mela. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale\nThe road to get here has not been easy. Puri, who has worked extensively in Panauti says most of the old monuments and points of interest (POIs) required individual attention and that is what stretched the nomination process.\n\u201cThe staggered approach to working on each site meant it took nearly two decades for us to get here,\u201d he says.\nPolitical unrest in the country also did not help as it affected the preservation effort along with the documentation process.\n\u201cThis meant the locals could not be as active as the local government was not proactive enough,\u201d said Bhandari.\nThe lack of skilled artisans to work on the heritage sites posed another issue.\n\u201cWe faced issues every step of the way,\u201d said Puri. \u201cThe file getting stuck at the Ministry of the Culture and the Council of Ministers did not help our cause either.\u201d \nRecognising the gravity of the situation, Puri\u2019s team of dedicated individuals together with the municipality stepped up to the plate.\n\u201cThree of our employees worked tirelessly, burning the midnight oil, to compile all the necessary paperwork and maps per the Nepal Gazette,\u201d says Puri.\nGeographical map sketched for documentation. Photo: Nasana Bajracharya\nThe lack of comprehensive research and documentation necessary to support the nominations has been another major obstacle.\n\u201cWe put together almost everything, the physical documentation of sites, temples, and their geographical distribution. There was no uniformity in the documentation. But we have everything we need now,\u201d says Puri.\nWith this goal in mind, the local community has rallied together to ensure the Indreshwar Mahadev temple is restored to its former glory. Puri says that the documentation work will be completed by September, while Bhandari pledges to finish his side of the administrative process within three months.\nWith the new mayor\u2019s coordination, Puri\u2019s team have made efforts to update the dossier, which will undergo a thorough review process to ensure it meets UNESCO\u2019s criteria and guidelines for World Heritage nomination.\nThe final decision regarding the inscription of a site is made by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee during its annual sessions. \n\u201cThe official announcement, however, will take at least two years,\u201d says Puri.\nWhy should Panauti be enlisted?\nIndreshwar Mahadev temple\nTo successfully nominate a site for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list, several key processes must be followed. The site must demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) and adequately represent both tangible and intangible cultural heritage. OUV considers factors such as the site\u2019s uniqueness, authenticity, and integrity, as well as its cultural or natural significance on a global scale.\n\u201cPanauti has all that in abundance,\u201d says Puri who says the town holds a unique and rich identity deeply rooted in its cultural heritage and historical significance. \nPurushottam Karmacharya, president of the Panauti Tourism Development Centre says the city is an open museum where every brick and every house narrates tales of the past.\n\u201cPanauti gets its name from Palanti, which in Nepal Bhasa signifies the need to step foot in the city at least once (Palaa ti) in a lifetime to cleanse one\u2019s sins. This spiritual aspect adds another layer to Panauti\u2019s identity, drawing pilgrims and seekers from far and wide,\u201d he says.\nThe core area of Panauti sends people back to the medieval age. \nAnother myth surrounding the city involves locals believing that Gautam Rishi, a revered Vedic sage, cursed Indra (God of Rain), leading him to come to Panauti to repent for his sins. At Triveni Ghat, Shiva infused the nectar of healing into the waters of Rudrawati. Upon bathing in this sacred river, Indra immediately recovered. Legend has it that every 12 years, the river carries the healing nectar, believed to cure all diseases.\n\u201cThat is why people come here every 12 years and take part in the Barhabarse Makar Mela,\u201d says Karmacharya.\nAnother famous legend is the story of Lord Rama and Ahilya, where Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, restores Ahilya to her human form after she was cursed to become a stone due to a misunderstanding.\nApart from all this, Karmacharya says Panauti\u2019s legend speaks of its generosity and community spirit. According to folklore, when it faced a water shortage, a Panauti farmer and the Lalitpur king went to goddess Phulchowki to ask for water. While the Lalitpur king brought gold and jewels, the farmer from Panauti took mustard flowers (yellow) and radish flowers (white) representing the necessity for water for irrigation in the region.\nAn old photo of the Indreshwar Mahadev temple. \n\u201cOther than the year-round festivals including the legendary Makar Mela, the intangible heritage of music, dance and other important festivals make Panauti unique. According to folklores, both the Kumari (Living Goddess) and Taleju first entered the valley through Panauti,\u201d says Bhandari.\nPuri, meanwhile, also highlights the historical importance of Panauti, highlighting the belief that the Indreshwar Mahadev temple, built in the 13th century, is the oldest temple in Nepal.\n\u201cThis is why we are pushing for Panauti to be enlisted to the world heritage site list,\u201d says Puri.\nIt has other revered sites such as Unmatta Bhairav and Bhadrakali temples that enhance cultural significance. Basuki Naag temple and the Tulanarayan Mandir (with a standing Vishnu statue), add to the allure of Panauti\u2019s cultural landscape.\nConsidering all Karmacharya insists that Panauti should be enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage site else it will be a big loss for both the locals and the nation.\nChallenges or opportunities\n\nDespite its abundant heritage, Panauti has yet to be effectively marketed to a wider audience, leaving its treasures relatively undiscovered, says Bhandari.\nHowever, the municipality and the locals are determined not to let the opportunity slip away, plans were set in motion to mobilise resources and skills. The task at hand is crucial, as a delegation from UNESCO would soon arrive to assess the site\u2019s eligibility for inclusion on the prestigious World Heritage list.\n\u201cWe had plans to enlist Panauti first. But now Tilaurakot is all set to be announced in the list. Panauti will be next,\u201d says Puri.\nThrough community discussions and information dissemination initiatives emphasising the importance of UNESCO listing, awareness has gradually increased. While progress may not be as swift as some locals anticipate or as slow as others fear, the focus remains on fostering understanding and engagement within the community.\nBhandari however notes that\u00a0the lack of effective coordination and integration between the local and provincial governments has further complicated matters. \n\u201cIssues such as cleaning the Punyamati River and ensuring alternative routes for vehicles carrying mining materials are a concern for now. Meanwhile, we want the provincial government to be involved in this too,\u201d he says.\nKarmarcharya also points out that the cultural city has seen some encroachment and some concerns about urbanisation, which have dented the holistic picture they want to paint suitable for the UNESCO heritage site. To counter this, he says, the local government is incentivising people to build houses in traditional architecture or at least maintain a traditional facade to preserve Panauti\u2019s cultural heritage.\nPuri has also observed how some individuals are still obsessing over how the enlistment will restrict them from building concrete houses.\n\u201cThere will always be people like this. But people, especially the younger generation, are understanding what we are trying to do,\u201d he says.\nWhat next?\nBramhayani temple. Photo: Abhiyan Dahal\nEnlistment as a UNESCO World Heritage site holds promise for Panauti, offering increased recognition on the global stage and elevating its cultural and social identity. Locals are optimistic about the potential benefits, foreseeing greater government accountability and increased investment in tourism infrastructure. \nAccording to Raman Sonam, operator of Hotel Panauti, a majority of tourists who reach the town come for sightseeing during the day or while returning from nearby hikes from Dhulikhel, Balthali, or Namobuddha.\n\u201cOnly 10 per cent stay the night with exceptions of those who have projects or surveys,\u201d says Sonam.\nRama Karmacharya, co-owner of Paaha Chhen, says it is a challenge to keep these tourists at Panauti for longer.\n\u201cWe need to start showcasing our local culture, food, and handicrafts and spread the word that Panauti is worth visiting. Being declared a world heritage site can surely put us on the global map,\u201d he says.\nPurushottam Karmacharya says that with better access, Panauti was ready to host more people. He says that although the number of international tourists remains modest, at approximately 1,500 per month, there has been a notable increase in domestic tourism.\n\u201cThe enlistment could bring more tourists to Panauti,\u201d says Puri. \u201cLocals are looking forward to how it will help boost the local economy. However, the influx of tourists should be handled with infrastructure development in line with the idea of sustainable tourism.\u201d\n\nLocals believe expanding hotel accommodations and tourism activities could further enhance the visitor experience, encouraging longer stays and boosting the local economy. However, Bhandari says there is no point rushing to do this. \n\u201cThe investors will see the potential and invest in the town. So, it is essential to strike a balance and ensure that growth is sustainable and respectful of Panauti\u2019s cultural heritage,\u201d says Bhandari. \u201cUltimately, enlistment as a UNESCO World Heritage site could provide the necessary impetus to unlock Panauti\u2019s full tourism potential, benefiting both locals and visitors alike.\u201d\nPuri also stresses the need to conserve cultural heritage continuously, both before and after enlistment, to prevent sites from being endangered, as observed in heritage sites worldwide.\n\u201cWe are blessed with abundant natural and cultural heritage. The Kathmandu Valley, once considered a heritage site in its entirety, has sadly witnessed significant destruction over the past five decades, with approximately 90 per cent of its heritage lost. So we need to preserve and promote Panauti accordingly,\u201d says Puri.\nMayor Bhandari agrees, \u201cRegardless of UNESCO heritage site enlistment, the preservation of heritage, language, and cultural identity remains paramount.\u201d\n\n\n\n ",

Photo: Shankar Giri\nIn a significant move towards ensuring transparency and competency in leadership, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal aimed to initiate a fair and open process for the appointment of the new vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University (TU).\nThe recently appointed vice-chancellor, Prof Dr Keshar Jung Baral, steps into a role that presents both challenges and opportunities crucial for shaping the future of education in Nepal.\nThe education system in Nepal is unique and deeply rooted in its cultural, geographical, and diversified ethos. As Baral assumes his responsibilities, he faces the daunting task of navigating the intricate balance between embracing modern education advancements and respecting the distinct characteristics of Nepal\u2019s educational landscape.\nOne of the fundamental aspects of this challenge is understanding that Nepal\u2019s education system cannot be replicated as is seen in foreign universities. While it is imperative to keep pace with global developments in education, it is equally important to tailor educational strategies that resonate with the cultural and geographical nuances of Nepal. Baral\u2019s leadership will be tested in striking this delicate balance, ensuring that the education system aligns with the needs of the nation.\nThe appointment of a vice-chancellor through a fair and open process marks a positive shift in the leadership selection approach. In contrast to past practices where competency was not always a primary consideration, this move reflects a commitment to elevating the standards of education in the country.\nDespite the concerns raised during the shortlisting process, the overall shift towards a more transparent selection process is a welcome development for the future of higher education in Nepal.\nAs Baral assumes the mantle, the onus is now on him to revitalise Tribhuvan University\u2019s education system. The challenges are evident, and the opportunities are vast. To achieve a successful tenure, the new vice-chancellor must prioritise several key aspects.\nMaking university degrees relevant and valuable\nKeshar Jung Baral\nThe first and foremost challenge is to instil confidence in students that a university degree is not just a certificate but a stepping stone to a successful career.\nThe degree programmes offered by TU must be regularly updated to meet the dynamic needs of the system, organisations, and industries. The newly appointed vice-chancellor should encourage a curriculum that is relevant, and practical, and equips students with the skills needed in the real world.\nOne of the significant hurdles is the scarcity of employment opportunities for university graduates. He needs to take a step forward to collaborate with industries and organisations to create avenues for internships, placements, and employment. By establishing strong partnerships, it can bridge the gap between academia and industry, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the professional world.\nEntrepreneurial skills development\n\nNepal faces a challenge in nurturing entrepreneurship skills among its youth. Baral should focus on integrating entrepreneurial education into the curriculum, providing students with the knowledge and mindset to create their opportunities.\nThis can be achieved through mentorship programs, incubators, and partnerships with successful entrepreneurs.\nMoreover, the quality of education is closely tied to the infrastructure available. He must prioritise infrastructure development, ensuring that TU campuses are equipped with modern facilities, libraries, laboratories, and technology.\nA conducive learning environment is crucial for fostering academic excellence.\nThen, investing in the enhancement of faculty and staff skills is paramount. Baral should advocate for continuous professional development programmes, workshops, and training sessions to ensure that TU\u2019s faculty remains at the forefront of educational practices.\nUniversity exams pattern and academic calendar\nPhoto: Pixabay\nA critical aspect of the educational system that needs attention is the redesigning of the university exam pattern. He should lead efforts to make exams more comprehensive and aligned with practical skills.\nAdditionally, adherence to an academic calendar and timely publication of results are imperative for smooth academic operations.\nTo enhance opportunities for students, Baral should initiate an active collaboration wing with multinational companies. Initiatives to bring these companies on campus for recruitment drives can significantly broaden employment horizons for students. Government support in this endeavour can further strengthen these partnerships.\nTo create a conducive environment for both faculty and students, Baral should work towards streamlining bureaucratic processes within the academic system. This includes doing away with unnecessary red tape, ensuring a respectful payment for faculty members, and fostering a positive and inclusive atmosphere.\nOne of the challenges that have plagued the education system in Nepal is political interference and the influence of student wings.\nBaral must strive to create an environment free from political pressures, ensuring that academic decisions are made based on merit and the best interests of the students and the university.\n ",

Photo by Praveen Kumar Mathivanan on Unsplash\nAn enactment of yelling from the highlands to deliver public notice for the villagers is still prevailing in some remote parts of the country. Such a practice prevails especially in those places where TV, radio or telecom networks do not work or people are unable to use such networks due to low-income levels or other various reasons.\nOn the other hand, people residing in urban areas are being updated with every second news of the world with immediate access to the internet. They are making instant comments and putting their opinions on current affairs through social media. Government and political leaders\u2019 activities are being monitored by the public anytime from anywhere.\nIt means there exists a division of people based on the access or use of networks and devices. Such a gap between people who have access to modern information and communications technology and those who do not is known as the digital divide.\nThe digital divide is due to unequal access and use of information and resources available in the modern digital world. The three major causes of the digital divide are unequal development and access to network infrastructures, unequal digital literacy and awareness levels, and unequal levels of income.\nSome people have enough access to networks however they lack proper knowledge and skills to use modern tools and technologies. Likewise, some people cannot afford such technologies due to their low income levels.\nDigital transformation\nPhoto by Hugh Han on Unsplash\nIn the modern days due to the advancement in information and communication technologies, the traditional way of marketing, payment and settlement has been drastically changed. Goods and services are being sold and purchased over the internet, payments are being cashless, and economic activities are being gradually digitalised so that the regular economy is transforming into a digital economy.\nThe term digital economy refers to the use of information technology to create or adapt, market or consume goods and services. Digital novelties include digital banking, e-commerce, virtual education, smartphone apps and collaboration platforms.\nAccording to US economist and statistician Thomas Mesenbourg in his 2001 paper, three components distinguish the digital economy from the regular economy as follows:\n1. Infrastructure: Businesses have software, hardware and other technological resources, plus specialist human talent.\n2. E-business: Computer applications, online tools and digital platforms help carry out business processes.\n3. E-commerce: A familiar concept, e-commerce means the sale of goods and services online.\nNepal\u2019s Status\nPhoto: Shakar Giri\nAccording to the latest report of the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), the population penetration of fixed broadband and mobile broadband based on subscription is 42.37 per cent and 95.30, respectively. This shows broadband subscriptions highly increasing in the later years.\nAs a positive impact of Covid-19, the access and usage of digital banking services tremendously escalated. As per the mid-December 2023 report of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the mobile banking customers are 22.624 million the internet banking customers are 17.886 million and the wallet users are 20.827 million. Comparing the data with the previous years, the percentage increase is 14.45 per cent, one per cent and 34.35 per cent, respectively. The number of transactions has also been significantly increased than in the past years.\nThe general literacy rate of Nepal stands at 76.3 per cent. As per the survey carried out by NRB, the financial literacy rate is 57.9 per cent and research showed that the digital literacy rate is staggering around 31 per cent. Moreover, the Nepal Police Cyber Bureau says the country has seen a steep rise in cybercrime cases over recent years.\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2022/23, 15.1 per cent of Nepal\u2019s population is under the poverty line \u2014 which means these populations live below USD 1.90 purchasing power parity/day. For this population access to the internet, smartphones, computers and other digital tools and technologies is just a daydream.\nScoring 0.5117 out of 1, Nepal currently ranks at 125 out of 193 member states listed in the e-Government Development Index (EGDI) of the United Nations (UN), which evaluates the national websites, and the effectiveness of the e-Government policies and strategies in the delivery of essential services of the member states. Likewise E-Participation Index is 0.2386 ranking the country in 143rd position. All these facts and figures show the hopeful but poor performance of the country towards digital transformation.\nChallenges\n\nDespite the lack of sufficient supporting policies and regulatory provisions, the digital transformation of the Nepali economy seems to be forcefully moving forward with enthusiasm.\nDigital initiatives from the private sector are now gradually expanded towards government entities. The increased number of e-commerce platforms, digital payment modes and people\u2019s eagerness to use such applications shows a very positive signal of the digital transformation of the Nepali economy.\nHowever, the ambiguous policy and weak regulatory provisions, the digital divide, the poor network infrastructures, the low level of digital literacy, the high cost of the internet, data privacy and security concerns etc are challenging. Among these digital divide is the major challenging factor for exploring the digital economy in Nepal.\nDue to the digital divide, government offices could not completely implement the delivery of their services via digital platforms which is an essential condition for promoting the digital economy.\nNext, people are reluctant to adopt new technology due to inadequate education and literacy programmes. People still prefer cash payments while following traditional customs and rituals, for example, huge demand for new banknotes during the Dashain festival for dakshina can be perceived.\nIronically it is observed that people are making online revenue payments but the vouchers have to be verified by visiting the bank and get stamped there. Likewise, the document such as the bill book of a vehicle can be renewed via digital wallet but the hardcopy should be stamped by visiting the corresponding office. Also, there are offices which cannot provide free WiFi networks however they are proclaiming service receivers to submit every document via the online platform.\nWay forward\nThe government should formulate clear-cut policies regarding the digital divide. Programmes like \u2018Internet for all\u2019 should be implemented through massive investment in the development and expansion of network infrastructures.\nDomestic trade should be linked with international trade thus promoting international e-commerce that includes the export of domestic goods and services through the streamlined arrangement of international payment gateway.\nThe quality of internet service should be ensured along with sufficient legal provisions. Proper monitoring of internet service providers (ISPs) and compensation for customers for not meeting standards by the ISPs should be guaranteed.\nDigital literacy programmes should be launched massively in digitally backward regions and communities. Educational institutions, social organisations and mass media could play crucial roles in providing education and raising awareness of digital issues, tools and technologies.\nPrivate sectors should continue their investment in digital technologies including start-ups and e-commerce businesses. They should offer products and services that cater to the diverse needs of the population.\nThrough the promotion of digital banking services and facilities, banks and financial institutions (BFIs) could play a vital role in the digital transformation of the economy. The financial access and inclusion could be inclined up with reliable and secure digital banking products of BFIs.\nApart from the above, regulatory bodies such as NTA and NRB should formulate clear-cut supportive policies to minimise the gap between people having and not having access to digital services and facilities, and promote the digital economy thus balancing the interest between the private sector and the consumers.\nIt means the government, regulatory bodies, service providers, the general public and all the stakeholders should work in tandem to minimise the digital divide and explore the digital economy throughout the country.\n ",

    "150": "\nPhoto by Mark Merner on Unsplash\nGreen hydrogen topics, including green ammonia, hydrogen fuel cells, and green urea, have regained traction in Nepal recently, drawing attention from universities to government agencies. The study published in 2008 by Prof Bhakta Bahadur Ale and Prof S.O Bade Shrestha from Tribhuvan University and Western Michigan University, respectively, can be considered the first official study on hydrogen energy in Nepal.\nThe study suggested using electricity from hydroelectric plants during off-peak hours to produce hydrogen, which could be used as a fuel, addressing energy inadequacy and peak load demands. However, due to prevalent load shedding, further discussions on hydrogen\u2019s potential were limited.\nHowever, after a long time, hydrogen has regained attention in Nepal, especially regarding green hydrogen production and use. Studies, including those conducted by the Asian Development Bank, underscore the international interest in Nepal\u2019s hydrogen potential.\nThe creation of the Green Hydrogen Laboratory at Kathmandu University has bolstered discourse and research in this domain. This has brought attention to increasing Nepal\u2019s research investment and the need for a proactive approach to organised research on green hydrogen. The worldwide move towards renewable energy underscores Nepal\u2019s strategic significance in this arena. Despite government interest and media coverage, Nepal has yet to actively promote hydrogen initiatives on the field compared to its nearest neighbours, India and China.\nSignificance of the Green Hydrogen Policy 2024\nWith the issuance and implementation of the Green Hydrogen Policy 2024 by the cabinet, the path for green hydrogen production, consumption, and development in Nepal has been officially paved. The ongoing discussions and debates show the critical role of this policy in the significant advancement of Nepal\u2019s green hydrogen sector. \nThe policy aims to harness green hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources as an energy alternative, contributing to carbon neutrality, energy security, and sustainable economic growth. It also sets long-term goals, including the enhancement of hydrogen production and usage through technological advancements. \nHowever, the policy\u2019s successful implementation necessitates the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks, infrastructure development, promoting green hydrogen industries, and further research and development initiatives. Translation and adoption of relevant policies and strategies are essential steps toward fostering a robust foundation for developing green hydrogen in Nepal.\nNeed of green hydrogen for Nepal\nA part of the Kathmandu valley is seen covered in smog, in March 2021. \nNepal stands as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The nation\u2019s economy heavily relies on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water, energy, and tourism. The impacts of climate change pose significant risks to Nepal\u2019s national gross domestic product (GDP), particularly in these sectors. The Paris Agreement, adhered to by Nepal, sets a goal for the country to derive 15 per cent of its national energy from renewable sources by 2030. Additionally, Nepal aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. In this regard, the government has initiated various policy measures to be implemented gradually.\nAccording to the Energy Sector Summary Report 2021/22 published by the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy, energy demand had decreased by around three per cent in 2020 compared to 2019, whereas in 2020, it surged again by 10 per cent to reach a total energy demand of 626,000 gigajoules.\nThe main reason for the overall decrease in energy demand in 2020 can be attributed to the reduced demand for petroleum energy due to the Covid crisis, making the resurge in 2020 quite obvious. As per the annual report of the Nepal Electricity Authority for 2023, the demand for electricity in 2021 increased by approximately 17 per cent, reaching around 8.8 gigawatts, or 31,680 gigajoules.\nWhen comparing the figures from 2019 to 2021, it can be seen that there is a loss of about 18 per cent in the demand for petroleum products in the overall energy sector, while renewable energy consumption has remained relatively stable at around 6 per cent.\nThis indicates that despite the increasing demand and consumption of energy in Nepal, there has not been as significant a shift towards renewable energy sources as one might expect. The facts presented in the Energy Sector Summary Report 2021/22 executive summary also indicate an annual growth rate of two per cent for imported fuels in recent years and a 15 per cent growth rate in electricity consumption over the past few years, yet electricity still accounts for less than five per cent of the national energy mix. These statistics emphasise the need for Nepal to rethink and reorient its national energy policy and the necessity towards a more strategic and sustainable direction.\nAgain, the data in the Energy Sector Summary Report 2022 forms the basis for understanding the current scenario of petroleum imports, which account for approximately 10 per cent of Nepal\u2019s total GDP, equivalent to about Rs 480 billion. Petroleum imports contribute to a 13 per cent trade deficit in the country\u2019s economy. Additionally, around Rs 21 billion is spent annually on importing chemical fertilisers from abroad.\nTherefore, hydrogen could emerge as a missing puzzle piece for Nepal\u2019s energy security and overall economic development. Hydrogen energy could replace imported fossil fuels in Nepal\u2019s industrial and transportation sectors.\nEstablishing chemical fertiliser plants using green hydrogen production could address the issue of fertiliser scarcity. Moreover, utilising hydrogen as an alternative energy source could contribute to pollution control, such as carbon emissions from industries like cement production.\nThe conversion of hydropower to hydrogen storage technology could also enable the utilisation of surplus electricity in the grid. By strategically harnessing hydrogen energy, Nepal can reduce its dependency on imports and enhance domestic investments, paving the way for internal investment growth in hydrogen energy.\nThe goal of reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change has made green hydrogen indispensable. Industries with high energy consumption, such as steel, cement, refineries, and heavy machinery, currently reliant on carbon-based fuels, are now shifting their focus towards green hydrogen on a global scale. Studying various nations\u2019 hydrogen and energy policies sheds light on this matter.\nNepal began its journey towards carbon trading with the initiation of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) programme in 2008, following the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. Additionally, in 2021, Nepal and the World Bank signed the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility agreement, estimating around $45 million in benefits from carbon emission reductions from Nepal\u2019s forest sector by 2025. These experiences could pave the way for Nepal\u2019s entry into the green hydrogen sector.\nAccording to a statistic released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an investment of $9.4 trillion in the green hydrogen sector is required globally by 2050, with $3.1 trillion directed towards developing nations.\nThe European Investment Bank has already committed \u20ac459 million to the Green Hydrogen Fund. Initiatives like the South Africa Hydrogen Fund, equivalent to $ 1 billion, have been announced to boost investment in green hydrogen. Nepal, drawing from its own experiences and lessons learned from international practices, could harness its natural resources strategically for the production of green hydrogen.\nEvaluation of energy markets, similar to the carbon trading framework, is essential to establish a baseline for evaluating the economic benefits. By presenting the natural advantages of green hydrogen and encouraging investment in carbon emission trading policies, Nepal could create a favourable environment for long-term gains. This could also provide clear benefits to other countries, as seen with the implementation of carbon emission trading policies in China, which has facilitated cooperation and increased the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI). Nepal\u2019s proactive approach to investing in green hydrogen could set a precedent at the international level for promoting environmentally and economically sustainable development.\nThe doors opened by the Green Hydrogen Policy 2024\nPhoto: Pexels/ Burak The Weekender\nThe Green Hydrogen Policy 2024 has laid the foundation for an attractive policy framework for energy sector professionals and investors in this field. It aims to encourage the establishment and promotion of industries involved in green hydrogen production based on necessity and viability criteria. \nThe policy provides provisions for incentives based on clear criteria. Areas where incentives can be provided are identified, including tax incentives for a certain period, incentives for value-added tax, and exemptions on final duties, as addressed by this policy. \nAdditionally, the policy addresses the provision of electricity at concessional rates by the Nepali government for industries directly involved in hydrogen production. It also addresses the construction of electricity transmission lines and stations for the distribution of electricity and necessary space acquisition according to legal provisions for the production, use, storage, and distribution of green hydrogen and its byproducts.\nThis policy confirms the presence of a market for green hydrogen in Nepal by taking clear steps towards the enhancement and encouragement of key sectors such as transportation, steel, cement industries, etc, for the consumption of green hydrogen. \nFurthermore, it facilitates investment by simplifying the acquisition of land for the development of electric power projects and by providing incentives for investment in industries that utilise electricity, such as the production of green hydrogen. \nAnother crucial aspect is the policy to streamline the commercialisation of products produced through green hydrogen utilisation. Alongside this, the government has formulated a strategy to promote domestic private-sector investment and government-private partnerships and attract international cooperation. \nLong-term budget allocation for research and development in this sector has been prioritised, recognising the global infancy of green hydrogen development and ensuring that immediate actions are taken to advance in this direction. With Nepal acquiring technological expertise in green hydrogen, there is a possibility of making significant progress on an international scale.\nAfter the inclusion of the budget in the policy statement, the implementation of the Green Hydrogen Policy 2024 appears quite promising. It is imperative to expedite the formulation of guidelines, procedures, and standards necessary to enforce this policy without delay. This will facilitate the effective implementation of the policy.\nAlthough the government has included various subjects related to producers and investors under the Green Hydrogen Policy 2024, it does not explicitly address the sector that will consume hydrogen. Special attention should also be given to the sector where consumption occurs to facilitate commercialisation and build a base market for green hydrogen.\n ",

    "154": "\n\nPatan High Court on December 1 ordered that the high-ranking defendants of the fake Bhutanese refugee scam remain in custody as the trial goes on. While the court ordered the release of half of those arrested in the case on bail, it did not release former minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and former Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand.\nIn addition to Khand, Indrajit Rai, an advisor to former Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, former Home Secretary Tek Narayan Pandey, and former lawmaker Ang Tawa Sherpa have also been ordered to be held in custody until the fake Bhutanese refugee scam proceedings are concluded.\nThe police arrested 20 individuals in connection to the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Among them, 10 have been granted release on bail. There are 10 more people who are currently on the run.\nThese individuals are accused of collecting millions of rupees from people by promising to facilitate their resettlement in the US as Bhutanese refugees. \nOn June 16, the Kathmandu District Court ordered the detention of 16 people involved in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. The accused then moved to the High Court against this order. But a joint bench of judges Janak Pandey and Prakash Kharel, upheld the order of the Kathmandu District Court, to keep eight individuals, including Indrajit Rai, Keshav Dulal, and Angtawa Sherpa, in custody.\nBoth judges unanimously also agreed that Sanu Bhandari, Keshav Dulal, Sandesh Sharma, Angtawa Sherpa, Govinda Chaudhary, and Sagar Rai, who are directly involved in collecting money from the victims, should be remanded in custody.\nBail bonds to a few\nThe individuals accused in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam being escorted out of the court. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale\nThe High Court also directed the release of six individuals on bail. Refugee leader Tek Nath Rizal has been asked to pay a bail amount of Rs 1.5 million. Rizal was granted bail after confirmation that he did not receive money from the accused. At 76 years old, he has been living in Nepal as a refugee and is deemed not to pose any risk of leaving the country.\nThe court also released Sandeep Rayamajhi, son of Top Bahadur Ramayajhi on a bail of Rs 3 million. Sandeep also denied receiving money and has been confirmed not to be involved in the investigation.\nAnother accused, Ramsharan KC, will be released upon payment of Rs 1.5 million in bail. Notably, Ramsharan KC was a victim himself and had filed a complaint against the accused with the Commission for Investigation of Abuse Of Authority. The High Court, recognising his health condition, has requested the specified bail amount for his release.\nHajj Committee Chairperson Shamsher Mia has been told to pay Rs 1 million in bail. The government vehicle allocated to him was reportedly misused for transporting fraudulent money. The High Court has directed Mia\u2019s release on bail without detention, citing the lack of confirmed involvement in fraud or acceptance of money on his part.\nFormer Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand\u2019s secretary, Narendra KC, has been instructed to pay Rs 1 million in bail. As the victims did not recognize him and he denied the allegations in court statements, the High Court has ruled against his detention. The decision is influenced by the fact that his name was mentioned in the message exchange between Keshav Dulal and Tek Narayan Pandey.\nThe High Court has requested a bail amount of Rs 1.5 million from Hari Bhakta Maharjan. Maharjan had demanded money from Sandesh Sharma to deposit in a cooperative. Based on this information and the absence of evidence indicating involvement in fraud, the High Court has ordered his release on bail.\nTanka Kumar Gurung, who has been released after posting a bail of Rs 1 million, has been asked to be released on a general date. The High Court has made this decision considering that the accused\u2019s presence at the hotel and restaurant for meetings, operated by Gurung, does not confirm his direct involvement. Therefore, the High Court has ordered his release without having to pay a bail amount.\nThe High Court has determined that Keshav Tuladhar should not be detained. The court reasoned that the victims did not mention his name, and the fact that the accused Hari Bhakta Maharjan used Tuladhar\u2019s bank account for transactions does not necessarily imply his involvement in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Consequently, the High Court has ordered his release on a general date.\nAshish Budhathoki has also been ordered to be released on a general date by the High Court. The court reasoned that since Budhathoki did not meet the victims and there is no evidence of him asking for money from anyone, he should not be detained. The High Court stressed that transferring money to an account should not be a basis for detention.\nLikewise, Lakshmi Maharjan has also been released on a general date. In her statement, she explained that her husband, Hari Bhakta Maharjan, managed her account and executed the transactions. Considering this and other factors, the High Court overturned the District Court\u2019s order, which required Lakshmi Maharjan to pay a bail of Rs 500,000, and directed her release on a general date.\nKhand\u2019s future\nPolice take former Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand to the Kathmandu District Court after his arrest for his alleged involvement in the production of fake Bhutanese refugee identification documents, in Kathmandu, on Wednesday, May 10, 2023.

One judge did not find sufficient grounds for the decision to detain him, while the other expressed that, considering the available evidence, he should not be released on bail. The debate will now be presented to a third judge.\nPatan High Court Spokesperson Tirtha Raj Bhattarai mentioned that parties who are dissatisfied with the order have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. \n\u201cAfter the corresponding paperwork is sent from here to the district court, the orders for the release of those individuals will be implemented.\u201d\n ",
    "155": "\nLocation of the Pancheshwar project at the Mahakali River.\nIt has been 55 years since Maharsingh Dhami, 78, of Dhamkudi in Pancheshwar Rural Municipality-1 of Baitadi started living in a hut on the banks of the Mahakali river. Since he was 26, Dhame made a small living on the banks of the Mahakali as he took Nepalis across the river and dropped them off in India. \nOver half a decade ago, Dhami charged people Rs 0.40 per person and an additional Rs 0.50 for their loads during the low tides month (October to May). The price went up significantly during the high tide months (June to October) as he charged people Rs 1.50 and Rs 2 for their loads. The rate for boat rides was approved by the then Dadeldhura district panchayat (a pseudo-governing body with a group of locally elected members) that oversaw many districts including Baitadi.\nDhami also used to work as a fisherman with Lok Bahadur Chand of Kulau in Baitadi. But following Chand\u2019s demise 15 years ago, Dhami could not bring himself to go back to the Mahakali river. \nHe continues to live on the banks of the river he does not row his boat anymore. Now in his twilight years, he has given the boat to someone else. Over time, Dhami has witnessed numerous changes around the area. The boat ride which cost as little as Rs 0.40, has now risen to Rs 50.\nWhat remains unchanged is the fact that the Pancheshwar hydropower project, which was intended to transform the lives of the locals, has not been constructed even after five decades.\nA tunnel for the Pancheshwar project\nDhami currently operates a small grocery store near the banks of the Mahakali river. Close to where he lives is the construction site of the Pancheshwar hydropower project.\nDhami recalls his parents and grandparents telling him how the Pancheshwar hydropower project would change their lives. \n\u201cAn entire generation has died yet the project has not started,\u201d says Dhami.\nUdham Singh Saud, 52, who took over Dhami\u2019s boat also heard the same from his father who told him their lives would change after this project was complete. However, now in his 50s, he has given up on that dream and is certain this project will not be complete during his lifetime.\n\u201cWhen we were kids, we were told that India had surveyed the area to build a hydropower project here. It has been four generations now and little work has been done. Four generations have come and gone and this project has been in limbo. We don\u2019t believe anything will happen now,\u201d says Saud.\nWhat is the Pancheshwar project?\nOn February 12, 1996, Nepal signed the historic Mahakali Treaty with India.\u00a0This agreement, signed between the then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his then-Indian counterpart PV Narasimha Rao, focused on hydropower generation and water management, including projects like the Sarada Barrage, Tanakpur Barrage, and the Pancheshwar Project along the Mahakali river.\nThe dam site for the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project was identified by the Indian side in 1956. Initially, the project report in 1971 indicated the project would produce 1,000 MW of electricity. However, in 1991, when the dam\u2019s design specified a height of 315 meters, it was established that the total output would be 6,480 MW. In 1995, Nepal prepared a detailed project report for its part in this project.\nThe project aimed to generate a total of 6,650 MW of electricity from Pancheshwar and an additional 250 MW from Rupaligad, with the goal of providing irrigation facilities in Kanchanpur and certain parts of India extending towards Nepal.\nSince its inception, the Pancheshwar project has been a recurring topic of discussion during every visit by the Prime Minister of Nepal to India. Things did move ahead this year with Nepal agreeing to sell around 10,000 MW of electricity to India in the near future.\nThat prompted Foreign Minister NP Saud to say that the Pancheshwar project had reached a breakthrough, with the DPR in its final stage. \n\u201cSeveral agreements have been finalised, encompassing the sale of 10,000 MW of electricity to India and the initiation of the Pancheshwar project,\u201d he said.\nHowever, according to Madhu Prasad Bhetuwal, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Pancheshwar Development Authority, despite discussions at various stages between the two countries, no concrete agreement has been reached among the experts concerning the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project.\nWhy the delay?\nMany years have passed since India set up a temporary office for the Pancheshwar Project along the Mahakali river, with Nepal establishing its office across the river. Nepal\u2019s government established its office on the Indian side in 1987 and four employees have been placed to work there for the last 36 years.\nOffice of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project.\nEven though the office has been set up, work remains stagnant due to the absence of an agreement between the two countries. Following the Mahakali Treaty, the Pancheshwar project was jointly inspected by Nepal and India, and it was subsequently placed under the Department of Electricity Development in 1993.\nThe Mahakali Treaty originally stipulated that the detailed project report (DPR) for the Pancheshwar project would be prepared within six months, and construction would be completed within eight years. \nDespite the completion of the DPR for Pancheshwar over three decades since the treaty, the actual implementation of the project remains elusive. Experts have suggested that India\u2019s reluctance to move forward with the Pancheshwar project is attributed to concerns about using the water from the Mahakali river. Additionally, the lack of clarity regarding the quantity of water consumed by India under the Mahakali Treaty has contributed to confusion and further hindered progress.\nProject and its impacts\nTo the east of the Pancheshwor dam site is Salla village and to the south is Santula village of Pancheshwar rural municipality-1 (Nepal) whereas, to the west is Nidil village of Champawat district and to the north is Sel village of Pithoragarh district (India).\nAccording to a study conducted in Nepal in 2012, the proposed 311-meter dam for the Pancheshwar project would have an impact on 17 villages, stretching from Pancheshwar village to areas as far as Baitadi and Darchula. The study estimated that over 20,000 people would be displaced across 21 villages.\nMeanwhile, another study conducted by India in 2016 for the Pancheshwar Project\u2019s Pancheshwar Dam indicated that a total of 49,666 people in 134 villages on the Indian side would be affected, along with an additional 4,822 people in the Rupali Gad area.\nHowever, there is no updated data on the affected population due to the absence of recent studies on both sides. The proposed height of the uppermost dam in the Pancheshwar project is 691 meters. It is reported that this project will cover an area of approximately 34.5 sq km on the Nepal side and 65.5 sq km on the Indian side.\nDespite the anticipation of employment opportunities for the residents of the affected areas after the project\u2019s construction, the issue of their management remains unresolved.\nDiwan Sarki, the ward chair of Pancheshwar Rural Municipality-1, said that the Pancheshwar project has faced obstacles due to the failure to reach an agreement between Nepal and India. \nBina Bhatt, the vice chairperson of the rural municipality, who has been aware of the Pancheshwar project from a young age, says that she has witnessed everyone\u2019s disappointment due to the lack of progress in the project. \n\u201cThe people here are already living with the expectation that they will secure jobs after its completion and that their current way of life will change. However, due to various reasons, there has been a recent surge of disappointment among the people. They claim that the project will be completed, but nothing has happened yet.\u201d\nBhatt believes that if the Pancheshwar project is built, many people will be displaced in both Nepal and India. \n\u201cYes, it may have been stopped for many years due to various treaties and agreements, but this project will transform the lives of both countries and its citizens, if there is economic growth, why not build it, the work should be started soon,\u201d said Bhatt.\nThey are compelled to recall the bitter reality that, for years, leaders representing local to national politics with the agenda of initiating the Pancheshwar project have been soliciting votes from the populace.\n\u201cIncluding Sher Bahadur Deuba, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who has risen to the position of Prime Minister from the Far West, and subsequent leaders who have held ministerial positions multiple times, have consistently made the Pancheshwar project an electoral agenda every year,\u201d says Bhana Saud (79) of Pancheshwar rural municipality-1.\n\u201cBut now, we are unsure about the type of leader we need to elect to see Pancheshwar come to fruition,\u201d she adds.\n ",

Arete International, the official dealer of Tesla in Nepal, made the electric sedan official. The new refreshed model, also termed Highland, was unveiled in Europe and later made available in the North American market before making its way to Nepal.\nThe new Model 3 boasts updated looks and performance features. The Standard Range with Real Wheel Drive option is exclusively available in Nepal, while another model offers the Long Range with All-Wheel Drive and Dual Motor option. These options vary in battery capacity, range, motor power, torque, and drive type, all of which are performance-related components. However, both options share the same design, dimensions, interior features, and safety features.\nThe Model 3\u2019s last update was back in 2019. With the significant updates it has got, the 2024 refresh will compete against the recently released BYD Seal. Both the electric sedans are going head to head in the electric sedan competition. While many prefer Tesla, BYD is also not backing up with the luxurious sedan Seal. \nWith the electric market making great progress in Nepal, Tesla has also been doing good in terms of numbers. India, one of the fast-moving and advancing in the EV market, still hasn\u2019t seen Tesla due to a lot of complications regarding tax and import regulations. Rumours have also stated that Tesla is making a budget-friendly EV for the Indian market under the $24,000 mark after other rumours of Tesla setting up factories in India. If the rumours come true, Nepal might also see a Tesla in the mid-range price. \nLet us see what the 2024 refresh delivers in terms of specs. \nSpecifications of 2024 Tesla Model 3\nDimensionsLength: 4,720 mmWidth: 2089 mmHeight: 1,440 mmWeight1,765 kgWheelbase2,875 mmGround Clearance138 mmBoot Space88 litres \u2013 Frunk594 litres \u2013 TrunkMotor typeAC permanent magnet synchronous motorAcceleration0-100 km/h \u2013 5.8 secondsDrive TypeRear Wheel DriveTransmission typeSingle speed fixed gearBattery57.5 kWCharging 11 kW AC170 kW DC (Max)Range550 Km (WLTP)BrakesFront: Four-piston fixed/320\u00a0mm/discRear: Integrated Electronic Parking Brake Sliding/335\u00a0mm/discSuspensionFront: Independent, double wishbone, coil spring/telescopic damper, sway barRear: Independent, multi-link, coil spring/telescopic damperTyresFront and Rear: 235/45R18Seats5ColoursStealth Grey | Pearl White | Deep Blue Metallic | Solid Black | Ultra RedPriceRs 13,500,000\nDesign\nThe major difference from the previous generation Model 3 is the design, both exterior and interior. The new design has been loved by many.\nExterior\nThe major difference can be seen in the front with the new angular headlights. The bean-shaped headlights in the older Model 3 are now sleek which gives a pointer face. Along with the headlights, the aerodynamics part on the hood is also increased with the sleek lines. The drag coefficient now stands at just 0.219 which increases the range and performance. The LED headlights and the DRLs have a much better throw. The fog lamps in the older version have now been removed. \nPhoto: Tesla\nOn the side, the new model gets the Nova 18-inch alloy wheels which look cool. From the side, much hasn\u2019t changed. The door handles are the same which pops out when unlocked. The side cameras are in the same place with better quality and fidelity. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe rear of the Model 3 also gets the new LED taillights which are also angular. The taillights are now one single piece which are attached to the boot. When the boot opens, the taillights also go up along with the tailgate. On the back, there is no Tesla logo, but Tesla is written in bold letters. \nPhoto: Tesla\nInterior\nThe interior of the 2024 Tesla Model 3 is much more quieter with the new seal. The door also has hinges below to seal the doors shut completely. The interior has a luxurious feel to it with Alcantara materials all over the dash and door areas. There is an LED light strip running across one side of the door to the front and to the door again in the front. The lighting can be changed with a lot of colour options available.\nPhoto: Tesla\nOne major difference in the 2024 Model 3 is the steering wheel section. The new steering wheel is not completely round. The major difference is the removal of the gear stalks and the indicator stalks. The indicators are now mounted on the steering wheel as buttons. The gear is shifted to the infotainment system. The right side of the steering wheel consists of the windshield wipers and the voice command button whereas the left side includes the high beam, media and volume button along with the indicator button. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe centre includes the larger 15.4-inch infotainment system. The right side of the infotainment system includes the gear shift controls. To drive the car, you need to press the brake and slide the icon forward whereas slide it opposite to reverse. In case, the infotainment system doesn\u2019t work, the P R N D buttons are just above the mirror. Like always Tesla does not have an instrument cluster, instead, the speed can be seen on the right side of the infotainment system. However, the infotainment system on Tesla is one of the most advanced and responsive ones. Even though there is no support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the functions work really well. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe middle of the electric sedan includes space for the wireless charger and the Key Fob. There are also two cupholders and sliding storage space.\nPhoto: Tesla\nAs for the seats, the 2024 Tesla Model 3 has comfortable seats at the front which are heated and ventilated. The headrests are soft which can be helpful during longer journeys. On the back, there is space for 3 people with a new feature added which is the 8-inch touchscreen. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe screen is able to control the AC for the rear seats and also has media entertainment features. The rear seats are heated but not ventilated.\nPhoto: Tesla\nThere is also a large glass roof like the other premium models from Tesla, however, the glass roof is not one single piece and has a beam in the middle which helps in the structural rigidity. Boot space on the Model 3 is increased with 594 litres on the trunk and 88 litres on the frunk for a total of 682 litres of boot space. \nPerformance\nThe 2024 Tesla Model 3 features a powerful AC permanent magnet synchronous motor, providing quick acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just 5.8 seconds. Its Rear-Wheel Drive ensures dynamic handling. With a single-speed fixed-gear transmission, driving is smooth and straightforward. The 57.5 kW battery offers ample power. Charging the electric sedan is convenient with options for 11 kW AC or a maximum of 170 kW DC. Its impressive range spans up to 550 km according to WLTP standards. The real-world range can be expected around the 500 km mark. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe braking system consists of four-piston fixed front brakes and integrated electronic parking brake sliding rear brakes, providing reliable stopping power. The suspension setup includes independent double-wishbone front and independent multi-link rear suspension, offering a comfortable ride. It is equipped with 235/45R18 tyres both front and rear, the Model 3 ensures solid traction and stability on the road.\nPhoto: Tesla\nSafety and Features \nThe 2024 Tesla Model 3 comes packed with safety features to keep you secure on the road. It\u2019s built with strong steel to shield you in a crash and has airbags and seatbelts that tighten up if there\u2019s an accident. Plus, it has smart tech like automatic braking, lane warnings, and cruise control that adjusts to traffic. Features like blind-spot alerts, parking assistance, and systems watch for safer driving. It has extras like a security system, traction control for slippery roads, and better headlights for night driving. \nThe features of the 2024 Tesla Model 3 are as follows;\n\nSleek modern design\nAll-around LED setup\nDrag Coefficient of 0.219\n550 km range (WLTP)\nRear Wheel Drive\n0-100 km/h \u2013 5.8 seconds\n682 litres total boot space\nHeated and Ventilated Seats\n15.4-inch infotainment system and 8-inch rear touchscreen\n360-degree safety \nGlass roof\nLED lighting \n\nThe 2024 Tesla Model 3 is available in 5 colour options; Stealth Grey, Pearl White, Deep Blue Metallic, Solid Black and Ultra Red. \nPhoto: Tesla\nThe official price of the available option of the 2024 Tesla Model 3 in Nepal is Rs 13,500,000. \n ",

Our food system today is dominated by fad diets and quick fixes.\nHowever, while returning to our original natural way of living is impractical today, there are ways to detox and revitalise our body and mind by fasting once in a while. I decided to experiment with the solutions provided by our ancient Vedic sciences.\u00a0\nAfter having scanned related literature, I took up the fasting challenge for 21 days. It is believed that in 21 days you can overhaul our body. This experiment helped me realise the depth of knowledge hidden within ancient Vedic scriptures. I could not help writing this piece to share my personal experience that has radically changed my approach to health and well-being. Even if this article inspires one person, that would be a success.\u00a0\nScientific and spiritual dimensions\nPhoto by Okan Caliskan for Pixabay\n\nAt the outset, it is crucial to dispel that 21 days on fruits and salads is a \u201cchallenge.\u201d Rather, it is a return to our natural state of flourishing, aligning with pure, nutrient-rich foods that our bodies were designed to relish and thrive on. Fruits and vegetables \u2013\u00a0 the core of this fast \u2013\u00a0 offer a bounty of essential nutrients without the excess calories and harmful additives found in processed foods.\u00a0\nWe are built in such a way that we can never overeat fruits, veggies, and natural food grains. For example, you have to eat at least 12 apples to gain as many calories as one fast-food meal (eg. McDonald\u2019s Big Mac meal has 1120 calories). But what matters is: that fruits and salads provide more nutrient-rich calories, compared to processed foods. This may be the reason why people tend to eat unusually large quantities if they are served the regular dal-bhat (processed rice), as compared to brown rice, dhido (millet), buckwheat, or chapati (full-grain bread).\u00a0\nThe 21-day diet\u00a0\n\nThere are thousands of very useful detox tips online, but it is only your mind and body that can best gauge what works for you. After over four years of testing my body with different diet plans, I gathered the strength to do the 21-day challenge, which turned out to be the most exciting.\u00a0\nWhat is interesting is that the quantity, type, timing and frequency of eating natural organic fruits and salads during these days were guided by my body and mind as my fruits and salads had no extra dressings, heating or chilling. The quantity you need to eat may be different for different people.\u00a0\n\nDuring the 21-day journey, I followed a simple yet highly nourishing routine to feed my body and mind: seasonal and organic fruits and salads, supplemented with a small number of sprouts and nuts in the morning for optimal nutrition. I took fruits for breakfast and salads for lunch and dinner and abstained from eating after sunset. I took a 30-minute direct sun every morning.\nFor the mind, I tried not to stress and think of any negative thoughts and practised morning yoga.\nThe first three days were a complete whirlpool, with my body experiencing what felt like monstrous storms, thunder and lightning. But then everything subsided in the next two days. What followed were days of complete calm, as my body and mind found harmony in the nourishing embrace of nature\u2019s bounty. The third week was an optimization.\nThe effects were nothing short of miraculous. With each passing day, I felt a surge of boundless energy, eliminating the everyday post-work exhaustion. I experienced a deep sense of satisfaction, knowing that I was nourishing my body with pure, organic fruits free from harmful chemicals and additives. I did before and after lab tests. Almost all my test reports were never so balanced. I was tempted to even declare: that I have found solutions to all problems. But that would be too naive a generalization about complex human health.\nWe are made of food we eat\nPhoto by Max on Unsplash\nIn reflecting on this journey, I am struck by the profound idea in the adage: \u201cWe are what we eat.\u201d The most natural solution to many of our modern ailments seems to lie not in complex medications, but in the simple act of nourishing our bodies with the foods we are meant to consume. According to Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 18, sloke 52), fasting is the best way to heal and purify the human body and mind.\u00a0\nAs I delved into the existing literature on the scientific and spiritual dimensions of fasting, I found a remarkable convergence between ancient Vedic teachings and modern research findings. While West literature offers a myriad of approaches to fasting, from intermittent fasting to Peterson\u2019s meat-only diets and the Gee Bryant Code, the wisdom of the Vedas provides a timeless blueprint for optimal health and vitality. \nWhile the West provides a range of non-deterministic and technically safe-looking conclusions through health science, which is completely ignorant of the spiritual dimension, the ancient Vedic scriptures seem to provide, with confidence, an impeccable solution that combines physics (food and body) with metaphysics (thought and mind). For the Vedic school of thought, the mind and body are integral, one cannot be detoxed if the other is feeding on toxins. This model requires our own mind to walk in harmony with our body.\nRisk and caution\nOf course, taking up this challenge has risks, and one has to approach it with caution. Consulting with a qualified dietician or doctor is important, as is having a strong faith in the power of the time-tested method, which is articulated in the oriental Vedic scriptures. Contrary to the belief that fruits and salads alone do not offer sufficient calories and nutrients, my personal experience suggests otherwise. Moreover, notable individuals like Patric Baboumian, one of the strongest men in the world, adhere to a vegetarian diet. And if it is for just 21 days, I believe, it is not a big deal.\nThe practice of fasting on fruits and vegetables is not merely a personal 21-day journey of self-discovery but an effective way to control your five senses and improve your willpower and resistance against bodily temptations, as advised by Bhagavad Gita, The Science of Fasting 2010 and several saints and scientists. \nFasting can be different but in general, as American scientist and author, Benjamin Franklin, said, \u201cThe best of all medicines is rest and fasting.\u201d \u00a0What should logically follow the 21 days is a personal transformation \u2013 and a strong conviction in the power of plant-based diets and in combining body and mind for a greater and more meaningful cause.\n ",
    "161": "\nBhakta Raj Acharya \nBhakta Raj Acharya, popularly known as Bhajan Siromani, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 82.\u00a0 Acharya, a chronic cancer patient, passed away on his way to the hospital. His demise marks the loss of another legendary figure in the Nepali music industry. He was a contemporary of Narayan Gopal and Prem Dhoj Pradhan.\nMutu Jali Rahecha, Hajar Sapana Haru ko, and Ma Kahi Katai Haraye Bhaney are among his evergreen songs.\nBorn in 1942 in Dhankuta, eastern Nepal, Acharya\u2019s family migrated to Kalimpong, after an epidemic. In Kalimpong, Acharya\u2019s struggles began as he lost his father at a young age. Raised by his mother, who worked on a tea farm, Acharya developed an interest in music while living there. Despite his passion, he dropped out of school to pursue music, much to his mother\u2019s anger. At the time, there seemed to be no promising future in the music industry.\nHis mind, however, was set. Music was all he wanted to do and he started to look for ways to do it.\nKalimpong to Kathmandu\nFrom Kalimpong, Bhakta Raj Acharya migrated to Kathmandu. His financial status was not great but he had a dream and he was willing to go through anything to fulfil it. All he brought from Kalimpong was a harmonium and a steel box. \nThen he began singing in Kathmandu. But, he did not achieve and earn anything and he ran out of money. Afterwards, he returned to Kalimpong.\u00a0\nAfter trying his luck with singing in Kathmandu and facing financial difficulties, Acharya found himself back in Kalimpong. However, encountering familial conflicts, he decided to return to Kathmandu. During the bus ride back, he made a promise to himself: he would not return home until he succeeded in becoming a singer.\nBhakta Raj Acharya is a legend in Nepal\u2019s music scene. A biopic titled Acharya has shed light on how much struggle he went through in his career. \nIn 1974, he won a gold medal in the National Level Singing Competition organised by Radio Nepal. This opened doors for him, leading to a job at Radio Nepal and marking the beginning of a flourishing musical career.\nThe versatile artist\n\n\n\nAcharya has sung around 500 songs. This included both originals and playback. He garnered acclaim for his musical compositions and was particularly renowned for his bhajans, earning him the title of Bhajan Siromani.\nHis influence extends beyond his own career, as his children, Satya Raj and Swaroop Raj, have carved out their own distinct identities in the Nepali music industry.\nThroughout his career, Acharya\u2019s songs have resonated deeply with listeners. His contributions to the Nepali music scene include iconic pieces such as Mutu Jali Rahecha, Jati Chot Dinchau, Jaha Chan Buddha Ko Aankha, Hajar Aankha Herne, and Sabai Behosi.\nBeginning of the end\nHis career was going great but in 1990 everything changed. A targeted attack on Bhakta Raj Acharya left him with a severe head injury. He was rushed to Bir Hospital, but it took 12 days before he underwent head surgery, performed by neurosurgeon Dr Upendra Devkota. This incident brought his singing career to an abrupt halt.\nIn 1993, Acharya faced another setback when he was diagnosed with an ulcer on his tongue, which later was identified as cancer. Subsequently, he underwent the amputation of his tongue. This left him unable to speak or eat properly, and many of his aspirations remained unfulfilled. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, he succeeded in realising his dream of contributing timeless songs to the Nepali music industry.\n\u201cWe have lost a legend, it is an unrecoverable loss,\u201d says music composer Sambhujit Baskota. \u201cHe was a university of music.\u201d\u00a0\nFor Baskota he was like an elder brother even though he was his contemporary.\n\u201cWe have had some really good times. The Nepali music industry owes a lot to him and he will always be remembered,\u201d he said.\nBaskota further says that Bhakta Raj Acharya is a testament to the power of dedicated practice in music, likening him to a university that demonstrates this effectiveness.\nBaskota, however, is disappointed with the government\u2019s indifference towards singers like Acharya.\nIn addition to his prowess as a singer, Bhakta Raj Acharya was also highly skilled as a music arranger.\n\u201cWe have lost a remarkable musician,\u201d says musician Alok Shree. \u201cSince the day Acharya was forced to stop singing, Nepal\u2019s music industry has been grappling with a shortage of quality music.\u201d\nAlok Shree reflects on Acharya\u2019s exceptional singing ability, noting his precise pronunciation and pitch.\nMusician Raju Singh echoes Alok Shree\u2019s sentiments regarding Acharya\u2019s impeccable pronunciation and singing prowess. \n\u201cHe was a singer of international calibre, known for his flawless pronunciation,\u201d Singh says.\nAt one point, Pakistani veteran ghazal singer Ghulam Ali praised Acharya\u2019s singing abilities.\nSingh stresses Acharya\u2019s role as an inspiration to Nepali singers, asserting that his songs will always be remembered fondly.\nAdios, Bhakta Raj Acharya.\u00a0\n ",

Photo: Pexels \nAs author Yuval Noah Harari aptly states, \u201cIn the 21st century, to conquer a country, you don\u2019t need soldiers, you need data.\u201d This sentiment highlights the increasing global importance of data, a trend that Nepal is not immune to. Recognizing this, long-time friends Anup Satyal and Bikranta Malla envisioned making a meaningful impact in the data sector in the country.\nBoth Satyal and Malla were abroad and possessed nearly a decade of experience in investment management and software engineering. Realising the potential of both in Nepal, the two returned during the Covid pandemic and started brainstorming what they could do.\n Upon their return, they observed a growing demand for information regarding Covid among the general public. Identifying this need, they assembled a small team skilled in data analytics and began publicly releasing data and reports on Covid cases visually. Their efforts garnered attention, and soon, the general public began expressing interest in their work, eagerly anticipating further contributions from them.\n\u201cThis made us realise that there is an opportunity in data analytics in Nepal, and then we started Xabit Analytics in 2021,\u201d says Satyal, co-founder of Xabit Analytics.\u00a0\nData use and decision making\nBased in Putalisadak, Kathmandu, Xabit Analytics is a company that integrates, analyses and utilises data.\u00a0 Besides the three above-mentioned works, the company also helps its clients in decision-making and implementation.\u00a0\nAccording to Satyal, Xabit Analytics is more than a technical company that provides data reports. He says that for them, data serves as a tool through which they advise their clients on decision-making and implementation strategies.\n\u201cWe are the only company that does this in Nepal. There were before us but none of them are in operation anymore,\u201d he says.\nSince its operation, Xabit Analytics has worked with six clients, with the majority being outsourced partnerships. There are several reasons behind the relatively smaller number of Nepali clients.\n\u201cAlthough everyone at the executive level understands the importance of data they are reluctant to invest,\u201d says Satyal.\u00a0 \u201cNepali companies have still not been able to understand the process of making data useful, and have failed to value the data.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat also creates a problem is Nepali businesses seeking immediate results.\n\u201cWhen they don\u2019t understand that it takes time, it becomes hard to work with them,\u201d says Satyal.\nNepal v West\nPhoto: Pexels \nThis is why Xabit Analytics likes working with foreign companies compared to Nepali ones.\n\u201cCommunication is clear with foreign clients. They provide us with what they want and give us the data but in Nepal things are different,\u201d says Satyal.\nNepali companies do not have clear goals and the necessary data, says Satyal.\n\u201cThe data teams of some companies are also reluctant to accept our analytics and are uncooperative. They act as if we are there to take their jobs,\u201d\u00a0he says.\nAs a result, the results of data analytics have not been up to the mark. But there are signs of change.\nThe people working at Xabit Analytics are predominantly young graduates. Interestingly, Xabit Analytics does not specifically seek out candidates with bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees in data science.\n\u201cWe prioritise individuals with strong analytical capabilities,\u201d says Satyal. \u201cWe prefer fresh graduates or young professionals, as Nepali companies are in the developing stages of data analytics, requiring less intense work.\u201d\nData security and the future\nPhot: Pxfuel\nWhen it comes to data security, for Xabit Analytics, privacy is of paramount importance. This is why, whenever they have the opportunity, Xabit Analytics takes the initiative to educate their clients and the general public that personal or personally identifiable information is not required for analytics purposes. By doing so, they ensure strict adherence to privacy standards and promote a better understanding of ethical data practices.\n\u201cThere is a misunderstanding among the people regarding data analytics. People think that we need personal or personally identifiable data for data analytics, but that is not true,\u201d says Satyal. \u201cFor instance, if we are doing the data analytics of a coffee shop, the coffee shop can just provide us the sales details of their items, without disclosing their real name.\u201d\u00a0\nHow long does it take to analyse data? That depends on the data\u2019s quality, says Satyal.\n\u201cIt can take a day or even months and years,\u201d he says.\nXabit Analytics dedicates the initial three months to cleaning the data, followed by an additional few months to derive actionable insights and generate reports.\nXabit Analytics primarily focuses on two major industries: retail and fintech. Satyal mentions that they have substantial experience in these sectors, particularly due to his expertise in them.\nFor the future, Xabit Analytics aims to expand its offerings beyond just data analytics and training for colleges and organisations. The company is planning to venture into product development using artificial intelligence (AI).\nSatyal says that in Nepal, many organizations are still not effectively using data. Therefore, Xabit Analytics sees an opportunity to address this gap by introducing AI-driven products that can enhance data usage and decision-making processes for businesses across various sectors\n\u201cWe feel there is a need for that in Nepal,\u201d he says.\n ",

It was during Indra Jatra that I felt most overwhelmed by the rituals and felt as if I had been in the presence of Gods.

She agreed and thus started her journey as an entrepreneur.\nSeena Khatri came to Kathmandu from Birgunj after completing her school. Growing up, she always wanted to become a banker and with that dream, she came to Kathmandu hoping to become one. That dream, however, was short-lived.\nAfter interning at a bank for a few months, she realised banking was not for her and joined a foreign employment company. The owner of that company was a high-profile businessperson in Nepal. Due to his influence, Khatri\u2019s life goal changed. After working in a foreign employment company, she got to know the various sides of business closely, and it fascinated her. She learned that to improve one\u2019s lifestyle, one must go beyond a job and do something on their own.\nShe was making good money at the foreign employment company. But working there she then started planning to start her own business saving money each month to start something she could call her own. \nOne day, as she was speaking with her friend about what business she could start.\n\u201cA friend suggested I should start selling protein. But that would cost around Rs 5 to 10 million to set up which I could not afford at the time,\u201d she said.\nKhatri\u2019s friend then suggested she meet people in the protein business. She agreed and thus started her journey as an entrepreneur.\nBirth of a businesswoman\nOsoaa Mass Gainer\nSeena Khatri admires people who take care of their bodies. As she ventured out to start a business in the field, she was filled with excitement. \n\u201cFitness has always been my interest, and I did not want to miss the opportunity of doing business related to it,\u201d says Khatri.\nTo start with, Khatri requested her friend to provide Rs 1 million worth of goods. With this support, her dream of starting her own business came true, and she began selling Osoaa Mass Gainer.\nWith this, she believes she is the first Nepali woman to be part of the protein business in the country. As she ventured into that, she also continued working at the Himalayan Building which she joined after quitting the the foreign employment company.\nLast year, she opened a physical store at Greenland Chowk in Tokha and also registered her product on Daraz.\nAccording to Khatri, the primary challenge in the protein business is the widespread belief among Nepali consumers that only Australian and American protein products are of high quality. However, through selling Osoaa Mass Gainer, Khatri has successfully demonstrated that even Indian products have a strong market in Nepal.\n\u201cA lot of people are buying protein from Daraz,\u201d says Khatri. \u201cThe response from customers has been good too.\u201d\nKhatri is excited and motivated by all the positive feedback she has received. She never anticipated the protein business to thrive as well as it has. With the business generating substantial profits, she feels satisfied by the success she has achieved so far.\nNo stopping her\n\nAs the protein business continued to grow, Khatri decided to venture into the bag business as well. The idea was suggested by one of her friends from Pokhara, but initially, Khatri did not show much interest. However, one day when her friend showed her photos of the bags with unique designs, Khatri was immediately captivated. Inspired by the creativity and uniqueness of the designs, she decided to start her own bag business.\n\u201cAlthough the bags come from India, the designs are our own,\u201d says Khatri. \u201cProducing these backs in Nepal is just not sustainable as factory costs are high so we bring them from India.\u201d\nThe bag, however, does not have a name yet. It is made up of metals and has interesting designs and patterns on them. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress and has been doing well given I started the business with only Rs 50,000,\u201d she says. \u201cThe response has been great.\u201d\nKhatri receives orders for 20 to 25 bags per day. That has excited her as she has been making a profit of around Rs 200,000 per month selling protein and bangs. \n\u201cI do all this after I finish my day job. I deliver most of it on my own and have been managing everything by myself so far.\nAmidst a trend where many youths are leaving the country in search of better opportunities, Khatri holds a different viewpoint. She believes that with hard work and dedication, one can build a successful future right here in Nepal. \nAccording to Khatri, the potential for growth and prosperity exists within the country itself, negating the need to seek opportunities elsewhere.\n ",

    "177": "\n\nA few weeks ago, rallies and meetings took place in various parts of the country, opposing federalism, advocating against the republic, and expressing support for the monarchy.\nThese protestors believe that the country would benefit from adopting a monarchy. They argue that an active monarchy, led by a king, is essential to eliminate disorder, anarchy, chaos, and corruption that have surfaced in the country.\nThe notion that, until the eighteenth century, the active monarchical state system was connected to the feudal system of production and the resulting consciousness.\nThe monarchical system represents a unitary state system, where citizens\u2019 rights are constrained. It was abolished because it was considered anti-development, anti-competitive, and anti-freedom. We have not only studied the unitary state system and active monarchy but also lived through the challenging era of active monarchy and the panchayat system before transitioning to a republic.\nWe have a history of nearly 70 years of struggle for the cessation of the monarchical state system in Nepal. Twelve years ago, the remnants of royal feudalism that had persisted were also eradicated. Therefore, it is essential to contemplate the reasons behind people demonstrating, including the demand for the unitary state system\u2014an obsolete concept that has vanished from the world and was terminated a decade ago in Nepal.\nWhat are the internal and external causes?\nRepresentational image. Photo: Pexels/ Recal Media\nDuring the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the Nepali people put an end to the monarchy. Following the monarchy\u2019s abolition, as Nepal entered the republican state system, the constitution directed the country to advance on the path of socialism through full democracy.\nHowever, the conflict between the outdated truths, the old thought system, and the antiquated state machinery, along with the progressive constitution and the clash between the federal republic and unitary thinking forces, led to the ascent of the latter in the final stages. \nThis divergence from the sentiments envisioned by the constitution resulted in the current situation we are witnessing today. The country is marred by anarchy, riots, chaos, disorder, and corruption, causing devastation to people\u2019s lives and weakening the economy.\nAs a result of widespread disillusionment, dissatisfaction and anger among the people, the old-fashioned thinking, and the powers that have ended in history, have fueled that anger, dissatisfaction and contradiction.\nThe situation appears to be heading towards concentration, with attempts to leverage religious sentiments by uniting the Hindu nation and advocating for the monarchy. It is essential to note that history cannot be reversed, and it would be imprudent to entertain the idea of reviving a unitary state that nearly ceased to exist in the 18th century.\nSuicidal to create a monarchy \nIn a context where the capitalist system is increasingly incapable of resolving global contradictions, advocating for a monarchy at a time when the future trajectory should be towards socialism with social justice is considered counterproductive. \nRepresentational image. Photo: Pexels/ Sebastian Voortman\nWhile one can empathise with the discontent and anger expressed on the streets, it is neither reasonable nor democratic to advocate for the return of the monarchy and the slogan of \u201cJai Desh Jai Naresh\u201d (Long Live the Country, Long Live the King). Such an idea is deemed anti-science, anti-progress, anti-history, and anti-democratic.\nDemocracy and monarchy are opposites, just as it would be foolish to say that a tiger and a goat can be kept in the same cage, it would be very foolish to say that republic and monarchy, civil rights and monarchy can be kept in the same system. \nDrawing an analogy, it is not sensible to assert that Tata Company should alter or replace a vehicle simply because a misguided guru has steered it towards causing accidents. The prudent course of action would be to deny driving permission to an uninformed Guruji who lacks comprehensive knowledge of how to operate a vehicle safely.\nThe current street uproar resembles the proverbial scenario of a foolish daughter expressing anger by urinating on her husband\u2019s lap. Therefore, the notion of restoring monarchy by undermining the republic is deemed a crude, undemocratic, and unpalatable joke.\nIt is crucial to transcend this outdated notion. The correct course of action is to progress by addressing the deficiencies within the republic rather than resorting to regressive alternatives.\n ",

    "181": "\nKeeping the concern over the discouraged borrowings and defaults on loans, the base rate has also been lowered. \nIn recent times, Nepal has witnessed enhancement in its external and monetary indicators, marking a significant turnaround in its economic landscape. A notable improvement is found in the current account and balance of payment, as the rising inflow of remittance paired with strengthened gross foreign reserves have resulted in a strong external sector of Nepal. \nAs of mid-December 2023, the gross foreign exchange reserve was USD 13.3 billion, which was a 36.7 per cent increase from that of the same period in 2022. The balance of payment has also seen a surplus of 210.6 billion rupees along with the remittance being Rs 613.25 billion. \nThe weighted averages of interest rates, encompassing the interbank rate, deposit rate and lending rate of commercial banks have all seen a decline; but the concerning thing is \u2013 people just are not taking out loans like they used to.\nSluggish economic growth\nRevenue collection\nThe previous fiscal year had seen the harrowing foreign exchange and balance of payment crisis, as the demand increased with the subsiding pandemic situation. This drove up imports in unprecedented ways and foreign exchange reserves plummeted to USD 9.75 billion.\nThe Government of Nepal was compelled to impose a ban on the import of luxury items to slow down the depleting reserves. In addition to the imports, the workers\u2019 remittance had also seen a decline as many Nepali workers abroad faced unemployment during the pandemic. \nThis exacerbated the problem. Presently, the external sector, though not entirely in the clear, exhibits marked improvement over the preceding year. The exports and imports for the five months of the fiscal year shrunk by 6.1 and 3.4 per cent respectively, which resulted in a subtle 3.1 per cent decline in the trade deficits.\nNepal imported goods worth Rs 642.209 billion which was 23 per cent less than that of the same period in fiscal year 2021/22 which stood at an import volume of Rs 838.4 billion. The current account, which was previously at a historic high deficit of 12.8 per cent of the GDP- amounting to Rs 41.2 billion- has also seen a surplus of Rs 140.2 billion in the current fiscal period.\nSimilarly, in the monetary sector, Nepal experiences a significant liquidity surplus. The reserve money held by banks and financial institutions has risen by 10 per cent, which rate is five times the one of the previous fiscal period. \nThe broad money supply has also increased by 14.4 per cent, exceeding the growth of 7.4 per cent of the previous year by almost double. Keeping the concern over the discouraged borrowings and defaults on loans, the base rate has also been lowered to 9.64 per cent from its 10.69 in the previous period. \nThe interbank rate, deposit rate and lending rate stand at 2.04, 7.62 and 11.85 per cent respectively which were brought down from 7.96, 8.46 and 12.74 per cent respectively. Clearly, the current economic scenario demands the flow of this excess liquidity into the economy in productive sectors, but the unusually prolonged duration of high interest rates seems to have discouraged loan demands and the perceived sluggish economic growth has imposed a new set of contemporary challenges.\nThe five-month data of the fiscal year reveals the government budget deficit of Rs 107.64 billion with the expenditure increasing by only 4.1 per cent. Out of the Rs 518 billion expenditure that has been incurred, roughly 16 per cent has been the only portion incurred for acquiring capital goods and development projects with long-term benefits.\nWhile it is expected that the completion of recent tendering processes would lead to an eventual increase in capital expenditures, it has become imperative that the private sector obtain the incentives to engage in productive economic activities.\nThe structural issue\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\nHere, the demographics of Nepal also come into play; for on one hand, the state is very much liable towards the ageing population; compelled to dedicate huge sums to financing expenses only- and on the other hand, the recurrent capital flight amongst the youth has imparted significant complexities to the economy. \nAccording to Gunakar Bhatta, the spokesperson of Nepal Rastra Bank, as the population of the active age group leaves, it shows a decline in consumption in an economy like Nepal- where around 90 per cent of the gross domestic product used to be consumed, which appears to be a structural issue.\nThe exodus of millions of Nepali youth is impacting the demand side of the economy along with the resource supply side. In conventional terms, such a reduction in consumption may have contributed to the limiting of inflation to 4.95 per cent on the national scale, but the personal experiences of the consumers in the market say otherwise. \nThe inflation in specific baskets of goods has not been brought down; for instance, the CPI inflation of cereal grains and their products remains at 11.3 per cent. Technically, the financial environment has stirred itself away from hostility but it yet is not friendly for the daily consumers.\nGiven the environment, it seems obligatory to encourage the entrepreneurs in the nation and opt for the utilisation of funds that have now been accumulating in commercial banks. The interest rates have been lowered but the government also requires strategic steps ensuring no impediments to the private sector development to create demands for investment. \nThe ever-recurring tradition of letting development goals be unsatiated must be overcome. In the current context of Nepal, utilising the resources available, ensuring dedicated growth by creating ample opportunities and overcoming the struggles of recession should be a huge priority.\n ",

    "190": "\nPhoto: Max Pixel\nReal estate refers to immovable property consisting of land and buildings and its natural resources such as water and minerals. Real estate is a significant and valuable investment. The process of purchasing and selling such properties is called real estate business.\nThe real estate business in Nepal has been on an upward swing since the 1980s. The ever-rising price of land has caused owning even a small area in urban parts of Kathmandu to be out of reach even for individuals with strong financial backgrounds, which is why understanding the financing options available and building relationships with financial institutions is important.\nNepal\u2019s real estate market has been influenced by factors such as population growth, urbanisation, and economic development. Ongoing and planned infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and public facilities, can influence property values and the overall attractiveness of certain areas.\nThe valuation of real estate can be improved, and it solely depends on modification or improvement, e.g. adding a pool or having a backyard with a patio can help improve the value of the property. A beginner can easily invest in real estate since it does not carry many complex investment structures.\nDrawbacks\nSince these properties are not liquid assets in case of emergency cash cannot be retrieved in the desired amount instantly. These properties require constant maintenance and dealing with tenants can be a tedious job for many investors.\nProper knowledge regarding legal and regulatory, market research and analysis, finance and investment as well as property valuation is needed.\nOpportunities\nPhoto by Tierra Mallorca on Unsplash\nThe business is a dependable source of passive income because it has limited liquidity compared to other investments.\nNepal is experiencing rapid urbanisation, particularly in major cities like Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. This trend creates demand for residential and commercial properties i.e. marts, restaurants and vacation properties purchase can be beneficial.\nReal Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is also available to help individuals buy real estate in the same way they could purchase mutual funds.\nRole of real estate in Nepal\nThe role of real estate in Nepal is crucial to the country\u2019s economic and social fabric. As Nepal experiences rapid urbanisation, the sector becomes a key driver of economic growth, providing employment opportunities and contributing significantly to the nation\u2019s GDP.\nAdditionally, this sector helps provide affordable housing to low-income families at minimum rates through the Nepal Housing Development Finance Company, established by the government of Nepal.\nThis sector is not only a driver of economic prosperity but also a key player in addressing the evolving needs of a growing and dynamic society.\nThe business in Nepal is very promising shaped by factors such as population growth in urban areas, infrastructure development, and the country\u2019s growing tourism industry and with proper knowledge and skill, an individual can undoubtedly produce great results in the long term.\nAs Nepal continues to open to global investments and embraces technology in real estate services, the industry holds growth potential, offering diverse prospects ranging from hospitality development to eco-friendly housing solutions.\n ",

    "192": "\nPhoto by Christian Lue on Unsplash\nNepal, situated at the vortex of expanding interest of her neighbours in South Asia and southwest China, holds a unique geopolitical position in the region and the world. Nepal\u2019s geographic location has always made it necessary for her to pursue a balanced foreign policy to gain goodwill from her immediate neighbours and other powers beyond the region. However, present-day Nepal has failed to attain these objectives.\nAs a result, the country has become a venue for rivalry between the two regional powers and the powers beyond. Nepal should turn the pages of history and learn lessons from the past; she should adopt those policies from the past, which had enabled her to keep all foreign powers at arm\u2019s length, ensure internal stability and thrive economically at the same time.\nRegional geopolitical history\nA brief survey of the regional geopolitical history illustrates that Nepal, shielded by the Himalayan rampart in the north and the thick malaria-infested forests in the southern Terai and further made inaccessible by the Chure and the Mahabharata ranges, had always remained a sovereign state.\nHowever, its immediate neighbours, Tibet and India, were not so fortunate. In the north, due to their domestic conflict, the Chinese intervened in Tibet\u2019s internal affairs in the 1720s. Towards the south, the Mughal power in India started to collapse in the 1750s, and the English East India Company, who had entered India as traders, started reaping the rewards of their successful campaigns.\nEven in such a situation, the tiny principalities of this Himalayan region managed to remain isolated from regional politics, protected by these two formidable barriers.\nSeven provinces as per the federal system in Nepal on the new political map of the country issued by the government of Nepal, on Monday, May 18, 2020, and launched on Wednesday, May 20, 2020\nWhen King Prithivi Narayan Shah initiated his military campaign to unify Nepal in the north, the Chinese had already deputed their Amban (Chinese Military Governors) to monitor and control local events in Tibet in 1728.\nIn the south, the English East India Company had established itself as a military power and vigorously expanded its control over the Indian subcontinent. However, the Gorkhas thwarted their ambitions and annihilated them at Shinduli on November 6, 1767.\nBased on his deep understanding of Nepal\u2019s delicate geo-strategic location, the great strategist Prithvi Narayan Shah compared Nepal to a \u201cYam between two boulders\u201d and stressed that Nepal must maintain a policy of equilibrium between its immediate neighbours.\nAfter the Anglo-Nepal War(1814-18160), the British curtailed Nepal\u2019s expansion and rose as an undisputable power in the Indian subcontinent. Towards the north, by 1818, more than 10 countries, including Nepal, were sending tribute missions to China, and the Chinese considered these countries to be under their suzerainty.\nHowever, after 1840, the Northern Imperial power started to decline. Furthermore, the influence of France and Russia around the Indian subcontinent also started to decrease. Fluctuations in power are inevitable in geopolitics; thus, given the harsh international reality of the 19th century, the Ranas of Nepal adopted a realistic approach and sought a friendly relationship with the British in India.\nYet, the Northern neighbour\u2019s attempts to assert her claim over Nepal had not ended. In 1913, they had invited Nepal to join her in a union of the \u201cFive Affiliated races, namely Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongolians, Tibetans, and Muslims.\u201d\nThey categorised Nepal amongst the so-called lost Chinese territories they hoped to reclaim. Thus, China sent numerous missions to Nepal to reaffirm its claim. Scholars mention that even in 1939, Mao Tse-tung had stated, \u201cNepal, Bhutan, and Burma were independent states that the Chinese had lost to the British Empire.\u201d \u00a0\nThe changed scenario in World War II\nWorld War II completely changed the existing world order. The collapse of imperial powers and the flowering of nationalism in colonised countries was followed by India gaining independence in 1947 and the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949.\nAfter independence, India adopted a policy of integrating her smaller neighbours into her security perimeter to promote India\u2019s interests. Amidst these regional changes, the Ranas, desperate to save their regime, signed the controversial Peace and Friendship and Trade and Commerce treaty with the Indians on July 31, 1950.\nAccording to scholars, the 1950 treaty attempted to abolish the sovereign status of Nepal recognised by the British through the 1923 treaty. However, because the UK, US and France had entered into diplomatic relations with Nepal before India gained independence, India refrained from taking direct action against Nepal, as it had done against the Indian princely states and Sikkim. Otherwise, Nepal\u2019s fate would have been sealed if that had not been the case.\nAcross the northern border, after what China terms \u201cliberating Tibet\u201d in 1950, Mao had stated, \u201cTibet as the palm and Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Ladakh and the north-eastern frontiers areas of India as the fingers.\u201d\nThis statement illustrates China\u2019s regional policy and its initial views of Nepal during that period. Only from 1955 onwards, after the Bandung Conference, did China and Nepal establish preliminary contacts that paved the way for establishing diplomatic relations. Since then, the relationship has gained steady momentum in the ensuing years.\nAt the beginning of the Cold War, the India \u2013 China relationship had been symbolised by\u00a0 the slogan \u201cHindi Chini Bhai Bhai.\u201dHowever, the honeymoon period ended after the brothers fought a war in 1962.\nNepal\u2019s unique geostrategic location between the two antagonistic powers of Asia, India and China, and the bitter relation between the United States and the Soviet Union ensured that almost all the powerful international actors became involved in Nepal.\nThus, hoping to prevent the rise of communist movements in Nepal and to keep it safe from China\u2019s and the former Soviet Union\u2019s influence, the United States started to assist Nepal in the 1950s. During that period, Nepal took full advantage of the situation by exploiting the differences of interest between the neighbours and the global powers.\nNepal\u2019s diplomatic relationships \nNepal\u2019s new Pokhara airport might fall prey to India-China tussle.\nNepal\u2019s interaction history with our two immediate neighbours demonstrates that China has always remained the critical balancer in Nepal\u2019s external politics. Using the Chinese factor, Bhimsen Thapa managed to keep the British at arm\u2019s length while he advanced towards the areas west of River Mahakali. China has always supported independent decisions made by Nepal, from Nepal\u2019s Zone of Peace proposal during the Cold War to the more dynamic, balanced diplomacy of the present era.\nOn the other hand, after independence, India\u2019s policy towards Nepal clearly illustrates that it desires to infringe on Nepal\u2019s independent status and ultimately bring Nepal under her fold. India\u2019s insolence has led to many political upheavals between the two countries.\nDetermined to maintain their special status, time and again, the Indians have imposed blockades on Nepal and signed multiple agreements with various groups in Nepal, which has been detrimental to Nepal\u2019s domestic and foreign policy.\nShe has not only encroached on Nepali territory but even established military posts inside Nepal\u2019s territory and laid claim to them. These incidents have exposed India\u2019s true intentions, thus leading many intellectuals to conclude that India has engineered political changes in Nepal to assert control over Nepal.\nAs for the US-Nepal relations, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ideological war ended, and the US interest in Nepal also faded. The American aid decreased substantially.\nHowever, with the recent rise of China, the US has sought to maintain closer links with India, and given Nepal\u2019s geostrategic importance, their interest in Nepal has also increased. The Americans have thus sought to reengage more intensely with Nepal.\nScholars have noted that the Trump administration had listed Nepal as a critical partner and sought to expand its defence relationship with Nepal. The present Biden administration aims to influence Nepal to shape the strategic environment in which China operates.\nThey proposed a grant agreement under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in September 2017 to develop the country\u2019s electrical transmission lines and road network. However, many critics interpret MCC as a part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy directed against China. However, Delhi firmly believes the US Indo-Pacific Strategy is a concept that is not directed against a third country.\nThe Chinese consider the US\u2019s growing strategic interests in Nepal a threat and want to counter it. Thus, they have prioritised their relationship with Nepal, and as a sign of their goodwill, Beijing signed a transit transport agreement for third-country trade with Kathmandu in 2016.\nThis agreement ended Nepal\u2019s exclusive reliance on India for transit trade. Then, in May 2017, Nepal became a signatory to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project. During President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Nepal in 2019, Nepal and China upgraded their comprehensive partnership to a strategic cooperation. The northern neighbour has established close military and security relations with Nepal and has overtaken India and the US in terms of military aid in recent years.\nBoth of Nepal\u2019s strong neighbours have adopted different policies towards Nepal. Furthermore, with the US\u2019s determination to place Nepal at the vanguard of their China strategy, Prithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s Yam is caught between these three boulders and has become the focal point of their competition.\nLessons to learn from King Prithvi Narayan Shah\nA portrait of King Prithvi Narayan Shah\nIn such a scenario, Nepal must heed the past, take lessons from King Prithvi Narayan Shah and adopt his policies. He had managed to keep all the foreign powers at arm\u2019s length while at the same time ensuring internal stability and a thriving economy.\nHe was an astute politician who understood that external affairs are an extension of internal affairs. An analytic study of his Divya Upadesh (final instructions) clearly illustrates that he strove for internal stability by looking after the welfare of the citizens.\nHe strengthened the military capability of the country and then cautioned that Nepal\u2019s external affairs should aim to maintain a treaty of friendship with the emperor of China and also keep a treaty of friendship with the emperor of the southern sea.\nThe great king\u2019s quote not only reflects the essence of unified Nepal\u2019s external and security policy but also contributes to determining her worldview. His instructions have served as a guideline for the Nepali rulers throughout history. Whenever the rulers of Nepal have failed to act according to these warnings and tried to divert internal political conflicts to the external sphere, they have invited trouble.\nIndia believes that Nepal has always remained under its sphere of influence and, thus, does not want China and the US to threaten its leverage, which they term a Big Brother role. Nepal should not discard India\u2019s Big Brother role.\nYet, it needs to adopt a strategy to keep them from interfering in Nepal\u2019s internal affairs, solve the border issues and focus mainly on better managing economic ties. China does not want an increased US presence in Nepal and desires to see Nepal prosper in her manner and not in the American way.\nRegarding China, Nepal should ensure that no anti-Chinese activities are conducted on Nepali soil and cautiously prioritise those projects that enhance Nepal\u2019s national interests. The United States thinks Chinese influence over Nepal is malign for their interest.\nNepal should become prudent and ensure that its partnership with the US focuses entirely on economic development and ensures its engagement with the United States does not threaten its immediate neighbour\u2019s national interest and security.\nTherefore, present-day Nepal should abide by the great king\u2019s instructions and use its geostrategic location to its advantage as the past rulers had done while dealing with the neighbouring emperors across the sea.\nNepal should strive for internal stability and enhance national unity to present a united front. It must maintain diplomatic relations with its neighbours and the powers beyond in a sensitive manner to widen its room for manoeuvring, protecting and promoting its national interests.\nAt the same time, it should maintain a strategic balance and respect the fundamental strategic concerns of these global powers, which are unwilling to lose Nepal to the other side and prevent Nepal from emerging as the centre of the geopolitical rivalry of the global powers.\n ",
    "193": "\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\nTo retain Nepali consumers Nepali industrialists are selling goods at low prices. However, the industries are paying a heavy price when the government too is not supportive of them. The controversy over power cuts in industrial areas is something we all have heard. So how has the government made the country\u2019s economy worse?\nIn the current context, all industries in Nepal are facing economic crises. In such a situation, when the government should be supporting industries, it has declared a load-shedding without any reason.\nSuch actions by the government discourage entrepreneurs. More importantly, electricity is even more necessary for industries, as power cuts affect not only industries but also the country\u2019s economy significantly.\nHowever, the government has declared load shedding in industries without any reason, without any research and without any prior notice.\nWho is to blame?\nThe blame for the decline in Nepal\u2019s economy lies with the government. They have made it mandatory for industries to use generators powered by diesel, leading to an increase in production costs.\nThis has given a boost to the recession. Production has been completely halted in some industries. Some industries have been fully shut down. When there is no production, there is no sale, but the burden of fixed costs such as bank interest and employee salaries and wages increases along with.\nIn a stable economy, the country\u2019s industries employ more people, import goods, process them, and sell them in the market, earning profits from the same process. People find employment, work day and night for salaries and that money circulates in consumption. The economy runs smoothly. This is the process of a stable economy that rotates in a circular shape.\nBut what happens when production is halted? Industries do not run, industries cannot produce, employees lose their jobs when employees lose their jobs, and they cannot support their livelihoods. This increases poverty, crime, theft, and unemployment. This also results in a shortage of manpower in the country. Due to the shortage of manpower, the cost of production and labour increases, leading to inflation. All these factors increase the risk of economic instability.\nWho is responsible for all these factors?\nFile: The front side of Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex of Nepal\nThe simple answer to this in one word is government. One such example is the condition of Triveni Group right now which owns more than 50 companies all over Nepal. \nThe Director of Triveni Group Saket Sanghai, handles five companies under Triveni Group \u2013 Amrit Bhog Rice, Nitya Rice, Amrit Oil, Amrit Daal and Royal Enfield( production side).\nAccording to the company, it employs more than 10,000 employees altogether. It is one of the largest oil producers in the country. Nepal is fully dependent on the import of raw agricultural crude oil products and paddy. Recently, it has launched a rice mill, introducing brands like Amrit Bhog Jeera Masino, Nitya Jira Masino, Amrit Sona Masuli, and Nitya Sona Masuli.\nDespite its capacity to produce eight metric tons per hour and its commitment to delivering quality rice products to the customers, its operation has been unexpectedly halted due to a government-imposed industrial electricity power cut-off.\nThis interruption comes at a critical moment for the company, just months into its production journey. As a new entrant in the industry, it is facing numerous financial obligations, including loan repayments, employee salaries, procurement of paddy, and various miscellaneous and operating expenses.\nHowever, without a reliable power supply, sustaining these commitments becomes immensely challenging.\nThe company urges the government to consider the significant impact such electricity disruptions have on burgeoning industries like it. Without consistent access to electricity, it is unable to fully realise its potential and contribute effectively to the economy.\nPolicymakers need to recognise the delicate balance between regulatory measures and supporting the growth of nascent industries, ensuring a conducive environment for sustainable development and economic prosperity.\nWhere is the government?\nThe government has been neglectful in dealing with this crisis in the long term. When industries do not run, people will be unemployed; money will not circulate in the market, causing currency inflation.\nMany industries have already been facing the brunt of the economic crisis. These companies are completely dependent on the import of raw agricultural products, and in the current context there is a huge rise in the price of raw materials and they have been facing a large trade deficit currently.\nThis unplanned and unresearched industrial power cut-off is very bad for the industrialists to survive in an already bruised economy. The prevailing load shedding in the industry can experience various consequences like there will be production disruption.\nWhen electricity supply is disrupted, industries face a multitude of challenges such as the duration and severity of the outage. One significant consequence is the disruption of production processes, as many industries heavily rely on electricity to power their machinery and equipment.\nWithout electricity, production lines may grind to a halt, leading to delays in manufacturing schedules and potential setbacks.\nConsequently, these interruptions can result in substantial financial losses, stemming from missed orders, unfulfilled commitments, and the inability to capitalise on sales opportunities.\nMoreover, electricity cut-offs will lead of causing delays and shortages of both raw materials and finished products. Extended periods without electricity can also damage an industry\u2019s reputation, leading to dissatisfaction among customers and stakeholders and eroding brand loyalty and market share over time.\nIn addition to immediate financial losses from halted production, industries may face additional operational costs associated with repairing damaged equipment, implementing emergency measures, and compensating for lost productivity, further exacerbating the impact of power outages.\nOne important thing that the Nepal government has ignored is electricity is a basic thing and it should be provided to the industries for its smooth run by the government.\nThe government should understand the value of producing goods within the country rather than importing goods and should support its industries. So, when will the Nepal government understand this plight?\n ",

And now Kollter has brought their first two electric motorcycles to Nepal, the Kollter ES1-S Pro and Kollter ES1-X Pro. The two motorcycles are the same bikes with different purposes, leading to different parts and performance features. \nThe ES1-S Pro is a more road-focused option whereas the the ES1-X Pro is more off-road-focused. The wheel type, drive type, range and top speed differ. The difference will target people with different choices. The electric bike competes against the Yatri P1 and Super Soco TC Max in Nepal. How can the two options perform with the increase in the electric two-wheeler market in Nepal? \nLet us see what the electric bike offers in terms of specs. \nSpecification of Kollter ES1-S Pro and Kollter ES1-X Pro\nDimensionsTyresKerb weightES1-S Pro: 135 kg ES1-X Pro: 132 kgGround clearance320mmMotor11 kW Axial flux motor air-cooledPeak power5 kWPeak torque220 NmTop speedES1-S Pro: 115 km/hES1-X Pro: 100km/hDrive trainES1-S Pro: BeltES1-X Pro: ChainBattery typeSamsung Lithium IonBattery capacity72V, 32 AhRangeES1-S Pro: 150 km ES1-X Pro: 135 kmCharging3.5 hoursFrameSteel twin-sparSuspensionFront: Upside-down telescopic forks, adjustable reboundRear: Monoshock, adjustable preloadBrake systemCombined Brake SystemBrake calipersFront: 300mm disc with linked three-piston calliperRear: 220mm disc with single-piston calliperTyresES1-S ProFront: 110/70-17Rear: 130/70-17ES1-X ProFront: 90/90-21Rear: 4.10 x 18Instrument clusterLCD-displayColoursWhite | Black PriceES1-S Pro: Rs 775,000 ES1-X Pro: Rs 775,000 \nDesign\nDesign-wise the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro are similar with the main difference seen in the drive train, wheel type and tyre type. The ES1-X Pro being more dirt-focused has a chain drive system whereas the ES1-S Pro has a belt drive system being more road and street-focused. The wheels on the ES1-S Pro are alloy wheels whereas the ES1-X Pro are spoked wheels. The tyres on the ES1-X Pro are thin and dirt and off-road focused with knobs for better grip in the dirt whereas the ES1-S Pro has a bit thicker type of tyres which are street oriented.\n\nOn the front, both electric bikes have LED headlamps with LED headlights, indicators and DRLs. The rear continues the LED styling with an LED taillamp and indicators which are placed in a triangular shape. Both the electric bikes have a huge ground clearance of 320mm. The single seat is comfortable whereas the handlebars are quite wide with all the necessary buttons to operate the bike. \n\nThe Kollter ES1-X Pro and the Kollter ES1-S Pro have a thin LCD on the front. The display is decent enough which displays speed, battery, range and time. On the side, we can see the battery placement and the graphics. The charging port is on the top of the fuel tank of internal combustion engine(ICE) bikes. The batteries are also removable which can be accessed by taking off the single seat. \n\nPerformance \nBoth the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro use 11 kW axial flux motors, providing a peak torque of 220 Nm. While the ES1-S Pro achieves a top speed of 115 km/h with its belt drive train, the ES1-X Pro reaches up to 100 km/h using a chain drive train, catering to different riding preferences. Both the electric bikes are powered by Samsung Lithium Ion batteries with a capacity of 72V and 32 Ah. The ES1-S Pro offers around 150 km of range whereas the ES1-X Pro gives around 135 km of range on a single charge. Recharging takes around 3.5 hours, ensuring minimal downtime between rides.\n\nBoth the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro have steel twin-spar frames for stability and durability. The suspension systems are the same and feature upside-down telescopic forks at the front and a monoshock with adjustable preload at the rear. \n\nThe braking system is a Combined Brake System on both models and uses a 300mm front disc with a linked three-piston calliper and a 220mm rear disc with a single-piston calliper. While the Kollter ES1-S Pro\u2019s tyre configuration consists of a 110/70-17 front and a 130/70-17 rear, the ES1-X Pro opts for a 90/90-21 front and a 4.10 x 18 rear. \n\nFeatures\nThe features of the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro are as follows:\n\nDrive Train: ES1-S Pro (Belt), ES1-X Pro (Chain)\nWheel Type: ES1-S Pro (Alloy), ES1-X Pro (Spoked)\nTop Speed: ES1-S Pro (115 km/h), ES1-X Pro (100 km/h)\nBattery Type: Samsung Lithium Ion (72V, 32 Ah)\nRange: ES1-S Pro (150 km), ES1-X Pro (135 km)\nSuspension: Upside-down telescopic forks (Front), Monoshock with adjustable preload (Rear)\nBraking System: Combined Brake System\nFront Disc Size: 300mm Rear Disc Size: 220mm\nTyre Configuration: ES1-S Pro (110/70-17 front, 130/70-17 rear) and ES1-X Pro (90/90-21 front, 4.10 x 18 rear)\nGround Clearance: 320mm\nThin LCD-display\n\nBoth the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro are available in two colour options; White and Black.\nThe price of the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro in Nepal is Rs 775,000. \nVerdict\nSo is Nepal ready for electric dirt bikes? The answer is yes and no at the same time. With the electric vehicle in both the two-wheeler and the four-wheeler segment increasing in number at a very high rate and the tax benefits, yes electric dirt bikes can be an option. However, as the charging network in the country is still not up to the mark, it might be quite difficult for people to rely fully on the range of these electric bikes. If it is for daily use travel on the city perimeters then the Kollter ES1-S Pro might be an excellent option to tackle the rough city roads, especially in the Kathmandu valley. \nBoth the Kollter ES1-S Pro and the Kollter ES1-X Pro have gotten pretty good responses in the European market. So how well can it perform in the Nepali market with the likes of other electric options available and new incoming in the future? \n ",

Photo by Patrik Michalicka on Unsplash\nWhile scrolling through my Instagram reel feed, I encountered a deeply unsettling video on the toothpaste brand Colgate Nepal\u2019s page.

He checks an X-ray and asks a nurse whether the patient is scheduled for a kidney transplant, only to be reminded it\u2019s an appendix removal.\u00a0\nThe same doctor then proceeds to prepare for an appendectomy with the bed still attached to his back, clumsily smashing instruments during the process. He is then berated by the nurse, stating he would not feel fully awake until brushing with Colgate MaxFresh gel. After brushing, the doctor miraculously becomes refreshed, the bed and pillows vanish, and only then does he proceed to address the patient.\nThe misuse of the medical profession in such illogical and disrespectful advertisements profoundly offends every medical professional. Being a practising doctor, I immediately commented on the video, demanding that Colgate Nepal remove it and issue a public apology for hurting the sentiments of medical professionals. To my dismay, my comment, along with others criticising the advertisement, was swiftly hidden by the page which after our outreach, is finally back now.\nBrands should be accountable\nCredit: FreePix\nDetermined to hold Colgate accountable, I reached out to their parent company, Colgate-Palmolive Limited, via email. The consumer affairs team of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited responded, claiming the video\u2019s narrative was simply meant to illustrate how Colgate MaxFresh toothpaste provides a jolt of morning freshness. They added:\n\u201cThe campaign reinforces the brand\u2019s dedication to freshness and also serves as a refreshing reminder of the positive influence the product can have on individuals, even in the most demanding circumstances.\u00a0 Having provided you with our perspective, as notified in the advisory, the commercial is a dramatic representation (is not a statement of fact) and is not meant to disrespect any profession. Our sincere apologies for any inadvertent inconvenience/disappointment caused with the assurance that we shall continue to strive to meet your expectations out of our future campaigns.\u201d\nMy social media team responded to the email, outlining the following points:\n\u201cYou cannot defame any profession in the name of advertisement by hiding behind an advisory that no one will notice. The main issue lies in the video\u2019s harmful influence! Are you suggesting these farcical situations actually occur inside hospitals? This video blatantly defames doctors and jeopardizes the crucial trust between doctors and patients. Instances of physical and verbal assault against doctors by patients, even when there is no negligence, are already a grave concern. Irresponsible videos like yours create a dangerous perception that:\n1. Doctors are chronically dizzy and sleepy.\n2. Doctors lack basic preparation before surgery, to the point of confusing appendectomies and kidney transplants \u2013 procedures performed by entirely different specialists.\n3.\u00a0 There is a high likelihood of medical errors, and doctors bear sole responsibility for any unexpected outcomes due to a supposed lack of preparedness and freshness. This fosters a hostile environment for healthcare providers.\u201d\nThis is an unacceptable act of negligence from a global brand. We are not living in the 17th century, where companies could advertise recklessly without consequence. Laws, ethics, and public sentiment must be respected.\u00a0 Deleting comments or citing a hidden advisory will not absolve you of responsibility for offending an entire medical community. I sincerely hope that Colgate will address this situation by removing the video and issuing a public apology for negatively influencing the public perception of doctors and surgeons.\nLet\u2019s be clear\nDoctors dedicate countless hours to saving lives, often sacrificing their health, family life, and personal well-being.\nTo see our profession undermined in such a manner is deeply hurtful.

    "209": "\nSome conservation officers at the park say restricting fishing is significant and proven successful for gharial conservation, as it would leave no fish for gharials in the river. Photo by Mochamad Arief on Unsplash\nFifty-six year-old Kaluram Bote has awaited the end of February, which marks a crucial time for gharial breeding in Chitwan, between Nepal\u2019s Terai and hilly regions. Rowing his boat in the Rapti River, he sets off on an early morning hunt for gharial eggs and fetches them back to the breeding centre. For more than two decades now, Kaluram has been deployed by Chitwan National Park to collect the reptile\u2019s eggs, which are hatched in captivity at the gharial breeding centre in Chitwan.\n\u201cOnce the eggs are collected and hatched in the breeding centre, the hatchlings are fed and taken care of in captivity until they are released in rivers to grow for the rest of their lives,\u201d says Kaluram, one of the Indigenous Bote people who works as a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the critically endangered species.\nThe park\u2019s gharial population has seen an\u00a0increase\u00a0over the past few years, from 239 in 2023 to 265 in early 2024. But despite this jump, the keepers\u2019 future, and that of other Bote people, is uncertain.\nSince the park\u2019s inception, there have been restrictions on fishing licenses to protect gharials. Indigenous Bote people, faced with the loss of ownership of their ancestral lands, have demanded their right to continue fishing in rivers without limitation, as it has been their traditional source of income. But many people can no longer see a future in fishing, even if the number of gharials eventually stabilises. And the livelihood alternatives they were offered, such as working as gharial keepers, have so far been insufficient, they say.\nKeepers like Kaluram only work a few months of the year, during spring, on a contractual basis and they have no job security.\nKaluram\u2019s home is one among the 115 households living on the banks of the Rapti River. Like his Bote ancestors, he has spent all his life fishing and rowing boats on the river, which flows from east to west through the Chitwan Valley forming the northern border of Chitwan National Park and joins the Gandaki River inside the park\u2019s protected area. When Chitwan National Park was created in 1973, many were evicted and they now have limited access to fishing upstream and to the protected area itself.\nFor generations, these communities have depended on fishing and forest resources for their livelihoods. In addition to the Indigenous Bote, ethnic communities including the Majhi, Kumal, Darai and Musahar have depended on fishing in Narayani and Rapti for their daily sustenance.\nAlthough many parents like Kaluram raised their children to be economically dependent on fishing, restrictions and insufficient livelihood options are changing their minds. They are now encouraging their kids to leave local communities to work as migrant labourers in Persian Gulf countries to lead a better material life.\n\u201cOur struggles are futile; it feels like we are dead because our voices are not heard,\u201d Kaluram says.\nThe gharial\u2019s traditional keepers\nIn a region hit hard by floods, building dikes is a popular demand, putting pressure on officials responsible for land-use and river management. Image by Abaya Raj Joshi for Mongabay.\n\nTo protect gharials from extinction, the government of Nepal launched the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center as a project at Kasara, Chitwan National Park, in 1978. Since then, a few Bote people have been hired to collect eggs in the wild during spring, while others work throughout the year as employees at the centre. Their traditional knowledge of gharial breeding and their role as the original keepers of the species made them an attractive choice.\nAmong the seven Bote people working in the breeding centre is Aitaram Bote, who has been a keeper for about three decades now. His daily routine includes feeding and taking care of gharial hatchlings and monitoring them.\nFrom boating to the riverside to collecting eggs, catching fish to feed gharials and taking care of the hatchlings, Bote people have significant roles to play in gharial conservation. In these years, there were several times when Aitaram was under attack. \u201cGharials are not as aggressive as the mugger crocodiles\u00a0but there still are risks persisting from both the species during the egg collection process. It is important to closely watch their movement when the process is carried out,\u201d he says.\nOnly mature females are capable of producing the maximum number of fertilised eggs, up to 60, laying one at a time every two or three minutes. The eggs are laid under fresh river sand about 60-90 cm (23-35 inches) deep. If they sense any kind of threat while producing eggs, they may lay their eggs on the riverbed, which could impact their survival.\n\u201cWe take care of every tiny detail and fetch the eggs to the breeding centre,\u201d says Kaluram.\nAt the breeding centre, the eggs grow into hatchlings for the next three months (mid-April to July) and are fed river fish until they are 5 or 6 years old. Once they grow up to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet), they are released back into the rivers.\nConservationists fear the Gharial Conservation Centre will have no gharials if enough attention isn\u2019t paid to save them.\nFrom 1981-2017, 1,246 gharials were released in the Rapti, Narayani, Kaligandanki, Koshi, Karnali and Babai rivers. However, gharial breeding is still a challenge. Conservationists point to unsustainable fishing practices, both subsistence and commercial, industrial pollution from nearby factories, sand mining and rock quarrying as the persisting problems.\nTo solve the fishing issue, they propose an option: During the three-month egg-to-hatchling journey, the fishers, including the Bote and other Indigenous groups holding fishing licenses, are not allowed to fish in the Gandaki and Rapti rivers. Their fishing nets, conservationists say, could harm the hatchlings and deplete fish for gharials.\nBote people with a license are only allowed to fish for nine months a year before they renew it at the end of the year. Although the issue of restricting licenses is the topic of frequent criticism and discussion between the community members and the park, the issue remains. This bars a new generation of community people from continuing to fish, sources tell Mongabay.\nNo other options?\nGharial conservation cannot exist with many communities economically depending on these rivers. Photo by Mochamad Arief on Unsplash\nOn Feb. 8, Chitwan National Park detained 13 Bote people, including four women and nine men who were fishing in the Narayani River, outside the protected area. The officials charged a fine of 500 rupees (about $3.75) each, a quarter of the earnings a fisher makes in a day.\nTwo weeks later, on Feb. 22, four other Bote fishers holding licenses were detained and each fined the same amount.\nThe Bote people in the region say such episodes of rights violation by the park are common, given that the community has long demanded rights to fishing and self-determination inscribed in the U.N. Declaraion on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Nepal ratified in 2007.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want us to fish in the river, as it could decline the fish population, posing risks to gharial conservation. But there are also a lot of conservation threats that persist otherwise, but the park is actively engaged in violating our right to self-determination,\u201d says Raj Kumar Bote, chairperson of the Bote Sewa Samaj Samiti, a rights-based organisation of the Bote people. Fishers call on using other measures, like reducing pollution and sand mining in the river upstream, to protect the species and their habitat instead.\nRiverine communities living on the fringes of Chitwan National Park have no land ownership certificate, though they have depended on the land, river and forest resources for their livelihoods for generations. Community members initially depended on gold panning, forest resources and fishing for daily sustenance before the park restricted these activities.\n\u201cThey restricted gold panning, and this is now followed by a fishing ban. We have culturally and economically depended on these rivers long before the park was launched,\u201d says Raj Kumar.\nHowever, some conservation officers at the park say restricting fishing is significant and has proven successful for gharial conservation, as it would leave no fish for gharials in the river.\nTo aid conservation, the park has banned fishers from using fishing nets locally known as\u00a0tiyari\u00a0\u2014 a new tight-knit plastic net that harms the gharial, as it can\u2019t set itself free once trapped. The traditional fishing nets, which fishers use today, are handwoven and leave space for gharials to set themselves free.\n\u201cIt is not necessary for Bote and other river-dependent communities to do fishing as their traditional occupation, especially when it poses threats to conservation,\u201d says Santa Bahadur Magar, who worked as a conservation officer at the breeding centre.\n\u201cThey fall back on fishing even if provided with other income-generation opportunities. Gharial conservation cannot exist with many communities economically depending on these rivers.\u201d\nHowever, Chitwan National Park\u2019s chief conservation officer, Dil Bahadur Purja Pun, says what is provided for communities is not enough. \u201cThe government-provided funds and resources are not adequate for the communities to opt for alternative livelihood options,\u201d Pun says, explaining that more needs to be done to protect the gharial\u2019s natural habitat.\nTo foster conservation, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation introduced a five-year\u00a0Gharial Conservation Action Plan\u00a0(2018-22), which allocated a budget to identify and manage the alternative livelihood options of fishing to river-dependent communities and initiate an amended provision of fishing on legal and policy instruments. However, the chairperson of Bote society, Raj Kumar Bote, emphasises that the funds that are allocated for marginalized communities don\u2019t end up improving the livelihood status of these communities \u201cbecause these funds never reach us.\u201d\n\u201cA few Bote serving in and out of the breeding centre for gharial conservation have been working on a contract basis, which means there is no job security or motivation provided by the national park to these people. The ones working out of the centre were previously hired for three months, which now has reduced to a month,\u201d he says.\nHaving more Bote people working in the park during the spring months when fishing is restricted could be an option, but lack of education to pass the necessary exams is a barrier to getting jobs as keepers.\nRaj Kumar also explains that people don\u2019t just rely on rivers because they can\u2019t find an alternative. For the Bote, the river is their origin \u2014 where their lives begin and where they should end.\n\u201cThe Bote people must harvest fish intestines themselves from rivers to perform the last rites of community people,\u201d he says, explaining that communities carry out funeral services near the rivers. \u201cFrom birth till the day we die, we are connected to the river.\u201d\n\nThis story\u00a0first appeared on Mongabay\u00a0and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.\n ",

    "215": "\n\nWhen artist Ranju Yadav was in grade 9, a woman in her neighbourhood was killed by a family member because she did not bring enough dowry after marriage. Learning about the incident traumatised her. She wanted to pour out this trauma somewhere, but at the time she had no idea how. For much of her life, the incident haunted her as she looked for means to express it.\nIt was not until 13 years ago that she finally got a chance to do so. It came in the form of Mithila art which helped her express the feelings inside. That liberated her and since then there has been no looking back for Yadav.\nRanju Yadav, a recipient of a national award, has innovatively transformed the traditional Mithila art, a folk art originating from the Mithila region. Traditionally, this art form is used to adorn houses and their surroundings, predominantly crafted by local women during religious occasions such as Chhath Puja and Ekadashi. However, Yadav has pushed beyond these traditional confines, pioneering a unique approach to the art form.\n\u201cOur society has various social evils and I want to raise my voice against those evil things through art,\u201d says Yadav.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSocial impact through art\n\nRanju Yadav\u2019s artwork revolves around the issues of dowry, child marriage, untouchability, female feticide and other gender-based violence.\u00a0\nYadav feels content with whatever she has been doing with the folk art style, not just because it has allowed her to express her voice against bad social practices but her art has also been helping to create a positive change in the society. Yadav has witnessed that her artwork has effectively made people aware.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe recalls her solo exhibition in 2019, Colours of Change, at the Nepal Art Council where her 29 paintings, depicting social evils were exhibited. The solo exhibition was visited by many people of Terai. One of the paintings, which had the head of a groom in the bull\u2019s body, garnered the attention of many visitors. Through her paintings, Yadav aims to convey a powerful message: that individuals who accept dowry are perceived as foolish in Nepali society, often likened to bulls (Goru) when exhibiting such behaviour.\nThat painting prompted many men to walk up to Yadav telling her they would not accept dowry.\n\u201cThis type of change is what makes me happy,\u201d she says.\nYadav feels her works are gradually creating an impact on people and society as a whole, and things like this motivate her to come up with more content that holds a strong social message.\u00a0\nGoing back to her root\n\nRanju Yadav now wants to exhibit an exhibition in the Tarai region, an area plagued by social evils such as child marriage, dowry, and female feticide. She intends to shed light on these deep-rooted issues in the hopes that the local population will become more aware of the detrimental practices they have been perpetuating for generations.\n\u201cOne painting can be equal to a thousand words,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nHer solo exhibition also had a painting that satirised the political leaders. In one of her paintings, the political leaders are observing the flood victims from the helicopter. She named the painting Disaster Tourism. The painting garnered significant appreciation from various audiences, including politicians. Remarkably, political figures such as Babu Ram Bhattarai and Pradip Gyawali shared Yadav\u2019s artwork on their social media platforms, indicating a positive reception even from within the political sphere.\nHer paintings also grabbed the attention of the then-Switzerland envoy to Nepal,\u00a0 Elisabeth Von Capeller.\u00a0 The Swiss envoy provided her with an opportunity for another solo exhibition on Swiss National Day.\u00a0 At that exhibition visitors from various international organisations appreciated her works and motivated her to do more such works.\u00a0\nGlobal recognition\n\nRanju Yadav\u2019s paintings are not confined to Nepal; they have also been exhibited outside the country. For instance, she participated in the Karnaphuli Folk Triennale in Bangladesh, the International Art Exhibition in Myanmar, the Nepal Art Fair in Bangladesh and the SAARC exhibition in Maldives.\u00a0\n\u201cI have a dream to promote the Mithila in every nook and corner of the world,\u201d says Yadav. \u00a0\u00a0\nAlthough Yavad has received remarkable achievements all these years through her painting skills, it has also been a tough ride for her.\u00a0\nShe remembers how people during her initial days as a professional Mithila artist used to demotivate her.\u00a0\n\u201cWe live in a society where people seek overnight success,\u201d says Yadav. Initially, people used to demotivate me by telling me I would earn nothing by becoming an artist.\u201d\nDespite initial scepticism, Yadav has defied all odds and achieved financial independence. However, her success is not solely attributed to her efforts. The encouragement she received from positive feedback on her work, coupled with unwavering support from her family members, played a pivotal role in her journey. Furthermore, her passion for art served as a driving force, motivating her to overcome challenges and pursue her goals with determination.\n\u201cI am passionate about art,\u201d she says.\nComing from a region where art education is not widely recognised, Yadav is deeply concerned about the plight of young individuals aspiring to pursue art as a career. She acknowledges the lack of support these youths face from both their families and society at large. This concern stems from her own experiences and the challenges she encountered while establishing herself in the art world.\n\u201cWe need to belive in ourselves. If we do that, we can create significant changes,\u201d says Yadav.\n ",

This is the brand\u2019s third official smartphone after the Nothing Phone (1) and the Nothing Phone (2). The Phone (2a) has got significant changes to be available in the mid-range market. However, the phone is significantly better than the Phone (1). \nNothing partnered up with CG recently to bring Nothing products to Nepal. The Nothing Phone (2) is set to be launched soon with CMF products which is the sub-brand of Nothing. With the partnership, we can also expect the Phone (2a) to launch soon in Nepal. \nThe smartphone was leaked with various renders coming out in the past few months. The Phone (2a) is set to compete against the Xiaomi Note 13 Pro, Realme 12 Pro and the POCO X6. \nLet us see what the smartphone offers in terms of specs. \nSpecifications of Nothing Phone (2a)\nDimensionsHeight: 161.74 mmWidth: 76.32 mmDepth: 8.55 mmWeight190 gDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2412 x 1084 (394 PPI)Refresh rate120 HzIP ratingIP54 dust and splash reistantGlass protectionCorning Gorilla Glass 5ChipsetMediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro (4nm)CPUOcta-core (2\u00d72.8 GHz Cortex-A715 & 6x 2.0 Cortex-A510)GPUMali-G610OSNothing OS 2.5 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 512GBRear camera50MP main camera50MP ultra-wide cameraSelfie camera32MPWi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac or ax (Wi-Fi 6BluetoothBluetooth 5.3NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual SIMAudioStereo speakersSensorsIn-display, optical), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compassBattery5,000 mAhCharging45W wired 0 \u2013 100%: 59 minutes0 \u2013 50%: 23 minutesColoursBlack | WhitePrice (expected)Rs 42,000 (8/128GB)Rs 45,000 (8/256GB)Rs 48,000 (12/256GB)\nDesign and Display\nThe design of the Nothing Phone (2a) is unique with mixed reactions. Some say it is good while others are confused about what it is. There are two parts on the back with the upper half containing the camera and the glyph interface and the lower half being a transparent back with a random cuved line. The plastic back is transparent when seen from the frame side, and some parts of the interior can be seen. \n\nThe glyph interface includes three light bars surrounding the round camera bump. The glyph interface on the Nothing Phone (2a) works very much like the one on the Nothing Phone (1) and Phone (2) with a few extra optimisations. The glyph interface works for the camera, music, notifications, ringtones, timer and volume. Few ride-sharing apps\u2019 timing can be seen from the glyph\u2019s upper left corner. The glyph interface has always been one of the most interesting and important features. On the side, the plastic frame has a matte finish. The buttons on the side are black on both the available colour options, black and white which gives a unique look to it. \n\nOn the display front, the Nothing Phone (2a) has a hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are almost equal on all the sides which are thin increasing the viewing experience. It has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a peak brightness of 1300 nits. The adaptive refresh rate of 120 Hz ensures smooth scrolling and transitions. It features a wide colour gamut of 1.07 billion colours and 100% DCI-P3 coverage producing lifelike and accurate colours. \n\nIt has a 91.65 per cent screen-to-body ratio and is certified with HDR10+ with a contrast ratio of 5,000,000:1. The display also has a touch sampling rate of up to 240 Hz and 2160 Hz PWM dimming minimizes eye strain for comfortable viewing. The Nothing Phone (2a) has IP54 dust and splash resistance and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front. The back being made up of plastic is prone to scratches but is sturdy enough to protect against accidental drops. \nPerformance, Software and Storage\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) delivers a powerful performance with its MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset built on a 4nm architecture. Its octa-core CPU combines two high-performance Cortex-A715 cores clocked at 2.8 GHz with six efficient Cortex-A510 cores clocked at 2.0 GHz. It is paired with the Mali-G610 GPU to handle the graphics rendering for proper gaming and multimedia experience.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) runs on Nothing OS based on Android 14. It is set to receive three years of major updates and four years of security updates. With Nothing OS, users can customize the smartphone for a faster and more intuitive experience with options to choose monochromatic themes and remove app labels for a clutter-free look, and access Nothing Widgets directly from home and lock screen, with swipeable views and animations.\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) features a 3,200 mm\u00b2 extra-large vapour chamber for faster and more even heat distribution, complemented by a 12,000 mm\u00b2 large cooling area with a thick 0.11 mm graphite layer for rapid heat dissipation.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) is available in two RAM options of 8GB and 12GB. The 8GB option is paired with 128GB and 256GB storage options whereas the 12GB option is paired with 256GB of storage. \nCamera\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) has a dual-rear camera setup. The main camera is a 50 MP sensor with a wide F1.88 aperture with optical and electronic image stabilization (OIS & EIS) and autofocus capabilities to capture steady and focused shots. The ultra-wide camera features another 50 MP sensor with a 114\u00b0 field of view for capturing expansive landscapes or group shots. When it comes to video recording, the rear cameras can shoot in 4K at 30fps and 1080p videos at 60fps. You can also record slow-motion videos at 1080p at 60fps. The rear camera has features like Action Mode, TrueLens Engine Ultra XDR, Motion Capture, Night Mode, and Portrait Optimizer. \n\nOn the front, the Nothing Phone (2a) features a 32 MP selfie camera with an F2.2 aperture, ideal for capturing clear and vibrant self-portraits. The front camera can record 1080p videos at 60fps.\n\nThe overall camera experience of the smartphone can be improved more in the future with software updates. The colour differentiation between the main rear camera and the ultra-wide camera is distinguishable. The rear camera also shoots two different kinds of photos in the same lighting conditions at the same time. Nothing can be improved on this part with further optimisation of the cameras. \nBattery and Others\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) ensures a day of performance with its 5000 mAh battery. For charging it supports 45W wired charging, taking around 59 minutes to reach 100 per cent and around 23 minutes to get to 50%.

    "218": "\nSantoshi Bankariya\nIn the Kabuliyati Forest of Musedhap, Manhari Rural Municipality-4, Makwanpur District, 92 Bankariyas reside in 21 houses. This is the only village in Nepal where one of the most endangered ethnic groups in Nepal lives. For most of their history, Bankariyas used to live in forest dens and huts, but now they are socialising to a considerable extent.\nThe community, which once kept its distance from others, has now opened its doors to visitors through homestays and has even established a soap factory. Emphasising the importance of education for both children and the elderly, they are striving to foster social change. Leading this effort is 29-year-old Santoshi Bankariya.\nNo one ever thought that a girl who used to run away from people and was afraid to go to school could lead a community towards prosperity. Here we present her story of how Santoshi Bankariya brought change within her community.\nLife in the unknown\n\nThis village settlement does not boast a long history. The dense forest of the Chure Hills acts as a barrier between Madhesh and the inner Madhesh region. Initially, they resided in the Chureghacha forest, situated approximately 22 kilometres south of Hetauda. According to one of the senior members of this community, the late Thule Bankariya, the history of the Bankariya community remained unknown until they settled in Chureghacha in 1983.\n\u201cIn 1994, journalist Mahendra Shrestha from Nepal Television, Pusphahari Camparai along with me, went to Chure Ghaan in search of Bankariya community for the news. After the news, their existence was discussed for the first time in the country,\u201d said journalist Pratap Bishta, the author of Chheliyeka Anuhar based on Bankariya\u2019s life. According to him, nobody had enquired about them before that. \u00a0\nHowever, the Bankariya community, with its obscure history and uncertain present, has now found its footing, largely thanks to the efforts of Santoshi Bankariya. Her tireless struggle has been instrumental in elevating the community\u2019s lifestyle and prospects. Her journey, marked by numerous hardships, serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience and determination required to effect meaningful change.\nSantoshi Bankariya, born in October 1995, has seven siblings. She first went to school in 2006, where she encountered initial nervousness as people viewed her differently.\n\u201cI was a Bankariya and there I was stepping into the unknown,\u201d she says.\nShe was the eldest among her classmates and did not even know how to hold a pen.\n\u201cIt was embarrassing,\u201d she says.\nAs time passed, the school became more manageable for Santoshi Bankariya, and in 2016, she passed the Secondary Education Examination (SEE), becoming the second person from her community to do so. Pampha Bankariya had been the first person to pass SEE in 2015. Following her success in the SEE, Santoshi Bankariya continued her educational journey and successfully passed the exam for Junior Technical Assistance (JTA) in crop science, equivalent to grade 12. With this achievement, she made history as the first woman in the Bankariya community to pass the JTA exam.\nSoaps, homestays and adult literary classes\n\nThe Bankariya community, traditionally reliant on the forest for sustenance, is now charting a course towards self-reliance by diversifying into three key areas: the soap industry, hospitality, and education. Santoshi Bankariya has been the driving force behind these initiatives, spearheading efforts to establish these ventures within the community. Through her leadership and vision, the community is gradually transitioning from dependence on the forest to economic independence through entrepreneurship and education.\nThe soap factory is being led by Santoshi and has 25 women from the Bankariya and Chepang communities who work under her. They make bath soaps and mouthwash using locally available herbs which are usually wasted in the village such as titepati, neempatta and ghyukumari. \u00a0\nSoap-making has emerged as a viable alternative source of income for members of the Bankariya community who do not rely on agriculture for their livelihood. In the past year, the National Indigenous Women Forum provided soap-making training to the women of the community. Inspired by this training, and under the leadership of Santoshi, the Bankariya Chepang Women\u2019s Soap Industry was established. This initiative, with a paid-up capital of Rs 1 million, was registered with the Small and Cottage Industries Office.\n\u201cWe learned how to make soap during the training, and now we produce and sell soap worth Rs 4,000 to 5,000 daily,\u201d says Santoshi. She further disclosed that she recently sold soap worth Rs 25,000 at the Manahari Mahotsav festival.\nIn 2019, a homestay project was initiated in the Bankariya community with the support of the Manhari Rural Municipality. Santoshi took the lead in organising this as a homestay was established in her own house, funded by an investment of Rs 800,000 from the municipality.\nThe Covid pandemic, however, affected the homestay operation as Nepal and the world went under lockdown. A from Switzerland was coming but had to cancel. To encourage the community, former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai spent a night there.\n\u201cWe made a homestay but no one came to stay except for one or two groups. That is why, now we have started the soap industry,\u201d said Santoshi.\nThe introduction of the Social Security Allowance played a significant role in catalyzing positive change within the Bankariya community within a remarkably short time. With a monthly allowance of Rs 4,000, women in the community began engaging in vegetable farming and animal husbandry, utilizing the savings from household expenses.\nAccording to local resident Suntali Bankariya, the women began saving their monthly allowances and deposited them into the local cooperative. Despite lacking formal education and financial literacy, Santoshi\u2019s guidance in adult literacy classes on the importance of saving prompted them to take action. \n\u201cAfter Santoshi taught us about saving our money in a cooperative in the adult literacy class, we went to the cooperative,\u201d says Suntali.\nSantoshi\u2019s classes also educated the locals about the importance of seeking medical care at hospitals when they fell ill. This practice discouraged people from consulting shamans when they were sick. Notably, Pampha, a member of the community, works as a technician at a laboratory.\nSince she was 15, Santoshi has been providing free education to local children. However, realising that her efforts alone were insufficient, she initiated adult literacy classes. It was through these adult literacy classes that many women, like Suntali, have transformed their lives.\nTo date, six individuals from the Bankariya community have successfully passed the Secondary Education Examination (SEE), and 15 children regularly attend Pashupatinath Secondary School. \n\u201cPratap sir used to warn me that if I stopped studying and got married, he would involve the police. I pursued my studies out of fear. Now I understand that it was for my own good,\u201d says Santoshi.\nAmong those educated by Santoshi, some have pursued journalism while others have enrolled in technical schools.\n\u201cPreviously, most of them would opt for work, but now many are prioritising education. Some have even ventured abroad,\u201d she says. \u201cI have realised that there is nothing more empowering than education in life.\u201d\nA changed settlement\n\nThe way of life of the Bankariya community has upgraded. Their thatched roof huts have transformed into temporary buildings with zinc sheets on the roof. Now, they grow their food through farming and animal husbandry.\n\u201cI survived eating yams and berries/fruits from the forest. I had not seen rice until I was 10,\u201d says Santoshi. \u201cAs we lived in the forest, no one knew about farming and growing crops and vegetables. Only after we came to Musedhap, we started farming by turning the river bank into a field.\u201d\nShe understands the importance of farming which is why she completed an 18-month course of JTA. After that, she worked as a volunteer in the Rural Municipality in 2019. \n\u201cAfter studying JTA, even if there was a job opportunity, I did not want to leave the settlement. I stayed in the village to do as much as possible for my community,\u201d she says.\nAlthough Santoshi Bankariya could have personally benefited from leaving her community, she felt that leaving meant abandoning her community. What helped her say was regular funds given to her by various organisations to stay and help the community grow.\nIn the past, integrating the Bankariya community, who relied on forest resources for their livelihoods, into agriculture was a challenging task. Additionally, they faced risks due to the presence of a nearby national park. Santoshi Bankariya took the initiative by bringing seeds to the village, cultivating them, and distributing them among the community members. She provided agricultural training to village women, resulting in increased agricultural productivity. Now, the community can sustain itself with the produce from their fields for approximately seven months.\nWhen asked about the next challenge, Santoshi highlighted that no one in the Bankariya community owns land. Despite a government programme aiming to construct houses for marginalised tribal communities, including theirs, they have yet to receive these homes. Despite continuous allocation of funds over several years, houses have not been built due to procedural issues that hinder progress.\n\u201cWe had already tried to build a house but the law does not allow us as they do not own the land,\u201d said Ekraj Upreti, outgoing chairman of Manhari Rural Municipality.\nIn 2005, the government allocated 10 acres of Kabuliyati forest to the Bankariya community for cultivation, with the agreement set to expire in April 2026. With only two years remaining, Santoshi expressed concerns about the community\u2019s future, stating that if the Parsa National Park demands their departure after the agreement ends, they will have no choice but to return to the forest.\nIn May 2022, Santoshi, accompanied by local representatives, visited Kathmandu seeking a resolution.

In the last three months, 650 foreigners have visited the Kanchenjunga area. According to the Information Officer at Kanchenjunga Conservation Area Management Council, Dobhan Limbu, there has been an increase of 211 foreign tourists in the current fiscal year. Last year it was 439.\nAccording to tourism entrepreneurs, there will be an increase in the flow of tourists in the second season spanning from April to June. \nWith the rise in the arrival of tourists, the tourism business has started returning to normal. Man Kumar Limbu, office secretary at the Council, said the Kanchenjunga mountain area, which has been deserted for a long time due to Covid-19, is slowly returning to normalcy.\nTourism is the main source of income for the communities living in the Kanchenjunga region. Tourism entrepreneurs and hoteliers have been encouraged by the arrival of tourists gradually.\n\n ",
    "220": "\nIndia skillfully maintains an equilibrium between traditional and digital advertising, with traditional mediums commanding 60 per cent and digital claiming a substantial 40 per cent.\nWhile the worst of the pandemic may be behind us, business uncertainties persist. Factors like rising raw material prices and overheads, ongoing conflicts in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, inflation and funding challenges in the startup industry contribute to a slower global growth rate.\nLet us look at the advertising industry, especially in comparison to India, Nepal\u2019s neighbour and an upcoming world powerhouse.\nAdvertising markets\nIn 2023, the global advertising index, ADEX, reached an impressive USD 971 billion, experiencing a five per cent growth rate. The United States, holding the largest market share at 31 per cent, showed a modest two per cent growth. Notably, India stood out with a remarkable 10 per cent growth, placing it among the fastest-growing advertising markets globally, alongside Brazil.\nAs per the Pitch Madison Ad Report \u2013 an annual report published by Madison World, India\u2019s advertising industry, valued at a staggering INR 99,038 crore, exhibited a robust growth rate of 10 per cent in 2023 and it is poised to surpass the INR 1 lakh crore mark in 2024. \nRemarkably rebounding from the pandemic setback in 2020, the sector not only recovered but surged past the 2019 market size by an impressive 37 per cent in 2021. In contrast to the global trend, India skillfully maintains an equilibrium between traditional and digital advertising, with traditional mediums commanding 60 per cent and digital claiming a substantial 40 per cent.\nTraditional advertising, encompassing TV, Print, Out of Home and Radio, continues to challenge the global narrative by asserting its dominance. TV experienced growth of seven per cent, Print exhibited a four per cent value increase (six per cent more in space consumption) and Out of Home & Radio made a noteworthy comeback with a growth rate exceeding 11 per cent. In 2023, the growth of digital activities in India slowed to 15 per cent, compared to 35 per cent in 2022 and 50 per cent in 2021.\nHowever, it still holds a significant 40 per cent share in the Indian market. \nOutperforming ADEX growth\nDigital activities are divided into categories \u2014 video (growing rapidly), social (growth rate decreasing), e-commerce, and search & display. The top 10 advertisers in India have not just kept pace but have outperformed the total ADEX growth by an impressive 2X, showcasing their strong belief in the power of advertising. \nNotably, six out of the top 10 are FMCG players, highlighting the significant benefits of their mass-appeal advertising strategy, with a major focus on traditional media, particularly TV. These insights reveal the resilience and adaptability of India\u2019s advertising landscape, positioning it as a thriving force in the global market.\nIt is important to highlight that decision-makers in both advertisers and agencies are increasingly digital-savvy. This trend is noticeable even in markets like Nepal, which have not experienced the same level of digital disruption as India and other regional counterparts. It is essential to adopt a balanced approach. While there is a widespread belief in the effectiveness of social media and digital platforms, the core media objectives of reaching diverse audiences in the country, including those with limited digital access, remain paramount.\nValuable insights for Nepal\n\nEven without specific ADEX data for Nepal, drawing parallels with India makes sense due to our similar audience profiles, values and cultural commonalities. While the absence of Nepal\u2019s ADEX data poses challenges, benchmarking against neighbouring countries, especially India, offers valuable insights. The growth and resilience observed in India\u2019s advertising sector serve as an encouraging example for the region.\nLarge advertisers, especially in FMCG, can boost confidence and drive growth in Nepal. To do this, they should use a smart mix of traditional and digital strategies that match Nepal\u2019s unique consumer insights. By learning from the trends and successes of neighbouring countries, Nepal can unlock untapped potential and create a thriving advertising scene. Adapting these best practices to local needs as the industry evolves will lift Nepal\u2019s advertising sector to new heights.\nExcitingly, there\u2019s a recent trend of successful Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in India\u2019s advertising sector. For instance, RK Swamy\u2019s IPO was widely supported and oversubscribed, showcasing its success. RK Swamy is a prominent marketing service group in India, providing a range of services under one roof. This success story mirrors another advertising firm that went public a year ago, experiencing a similar oversubscription in India.\nThis enthusiasm for marketing service firms is a positive start for the region, suggesting potential success in the broader South Asian market. While listed advertising conglomerates are not a new concept globally, the recent wins in India are promising.\nThis trend can be seen as a positive impetus for establishing a company culture that prioritises team structure, transparency and technology integration. Such an environment provides a robust platform for the younger generation to contribute their innovation and creativity. It makes Nepal an appealing destination for them to build their professional careers.\n\n ",
    "221": "\nPeople writing exams for visually impaired students. Photo: Bindaas Madhavi/Flickr\nInitiatives aimed at inclusivity and empowerment often stem from acknowledging long-standing issues that have been conveniently swept under the rug. Take, for instance, the glaring problem of authenticating signatures for individuals with visual impairments.\nThis obstacle not only strips away their autonomy but also shackles them to a perpetual cycle of dependence. Yet, amidst this bleak scenario, Prayatna Nepal emerged with a glimmer of hope in the form of its signature training programme.\nLaunched in 2017, this initiative, spearheaded by Sundip Gyawali in partnership with the organisation, stands as a bold attempt to break free from the chains of fingerprint reliance.\nThe significance of signature training\nSignature training, an often overlooked facet in the field of accessibility, holds undeniable importance, particularly when addressing the formidable challenges faced by visually impaired individuals attempting to navigate and reproduce signatures.\nThe hurdles they confront go beyond mere inconvenience, emerging as substantial barriers that impede their autonomy across pivotal domains such as education, finance, and parenting. The ramifications of this struggle are not confined solely to general visually impaired individuals; even educators with vision impairment, armed with academic qualifications, find themselves ensnared in a web of marginalisation due to the difficulties they encounter in signing documents.\nThis predicament not only hampers their professional advancement but also inflicts damage on their self-esteem. The urgency of finding effective solutions in this often neglected facet of accessibility is glaring, as it directly impacts the lives and opportunities of those grappling with the challenges of signature replication.\nFurthermore, the issue goes beyond education, plaguing visually impaired parents with comparable obstacles when it comes to navigating bureaucratic red tape concerning their children\u2019s schooling and welfare.\nThe struggle does not stop there; mundane tasks like attending events or conducting banking affairs turn into veritable minefields due to the inability to wield a traditional signature. This lack of a functional autograph not only erects barriers but also subjects individuals to feelings of ostracisation and degradation.\nGandaki province-specific training\nPhoto: Global Partnership for Education\nThe prerequisite to cater to the distinct demands of teachers, particularly those with visual impairments, in the task of independently signing documents was acknowledged as a challenge.\nIn response, Prayatna Nepal organised specialised signature training sessions tailored specifically for educators in Gandaki province. These sessions were designed to address the unique needs of the province\u2019s teachers, ensuring that they could confidently carry out their daily responsibilities without dependency.\nThrough strategic alignment with their typical work routines, the objective of Prayatna Nepal was to not only impart necessary skills but also to ensure self-assurance and autonomy among the teaching community.\nThe technique\nSignature training employs a unique technique where participants practice writing alphabets using slates and styluses on braille paper.\nInitially, the focus is on mastering alphabet formulas, progressing to writing them with a pen on a slate board. Once proficiency in writing their names independently is achieved, participants are encouraged to create personalised signatures on plain paper, tapping into their creativity.\nUnderstanding the signature guide\nA vital tool in this training is the signature guide, a wooden square providing a small writing space that allows participants to write in a straight line without relying on a slate board. This innovation empowers visually impaired individuals by offering them a tangible guide to develop and refine their signatures independently.\nIn conclusion, the strides made by initiatives like Prayatna Nepal\u2019s signature training programme underscore a crucial shift towards inclusivity and empowerment for visually impaired individuals, particularly educators. By addressing the often overlooked challenge of signature replication, these initiatives dismantle barriers to autonomy and pave the way for greater participation in essential aspects of life such as education, finance, and parenting.\nThe specialised training sessions tailored to the unique needs of educators in Gandaki Province exemplify a targeted approach that not only imparts necessary skills but also strengthens self-assurance and independence. Embracing innovative techniques and tools like the signature guide not only enables individuals to operate bureaucratic complexities with confidence but also affirms their dignity and worth. Moving forward, such efforts must continue to be championed, ensuring that no individual is left behind in the pursuit of a truly inclusive society.\nIt is high time to realise and inculcate the practical essence of inclusion guided by the principles of equity and empathy when striving to empower visually impaired educators and individuals alike to realise their full potential and contribute meaningfully to the collective effort towards progress and inclusivity.\n ",

    "224": "\nCAGR can be used to assess the average annual growth rate of various investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies, and retirement accounts. Photo: Pexels/ Cottonbro\nImagine your money going on a rollercoaster ride in the stock market or any investment. That is the same factor that pulled people into investing in the stock market today. But what they look for is an immediate growth. But getting rich in the stock market is all about the long game, a little bit of luck and a lot of patience.\u00a0\nIn the long run, one can get rich in their investment, stock or otherwise, without doing anything. You just use the power of math and let that bank in the money for you while you focus on your life. In other words, it is the steady growth rate that helps you see the big picture without the financial rollercoaster.\nSo what is the big secret? It is all about Compound Annual Growth Rate or CAGR.\nTechnically, CAGR is a measure used to determine the annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period, assuming that the investment has been compounding over that period. It provides a smoothed annual rate of growth, taking into account the effects of compounding.\nIn any moment of confusion about different investment options, it is like the much-needed sense of which investment is worth pursuing in the long run. CAGR can be used to assess the average annual growth rate of various investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies, and retirement accounts.\nHow to calculate CAGR\nThe formula for calculating CAGR is:\n\nIn the formula:\nEnding Value or EV represents the ending value of the investment or asset.\u00a0\nBeginning Value or BV represents the beginning value of the investment or asset.\nN represents the number of years.\nAssuming an initial investment of Rs 1,000,000 and an end value of 3,000,000 (rounded off), we\u2019ll calculate the CAGR after 15 years.\nSo, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for this investment, with an initial value of Rs 1,000,000 and an ending value of Rs 3,000,000 over 15 years, is approximately 7.7 per cent.\u00a0\nAnalysing the end game\nBut you want to find out the end value or how much you will acquire from your initial investment. So the formula to use here would be:\u00a0\n\nHere, assuming an initial investment of Rs 1,000,000 and a CAGR of 5 per cent, we will calculate the Ending Value after 15 years.\n\nTherefore, assuming there is an annual growth rate of 5 per cent, the future value of a Rs 1,000,000 investment after 15 years would be approximately Rs 2,078,928.\u00a0\nPower of compounding\u00a0\nYou might be asking why use CAGR in the first place. The interest rates given by your current banks are enough. Because they calculate the return in simple interest.\u00a0\nYour savings and fixed deposits are of course not bad, they are your safest bets and you should have them and diversify your assets. But the difference does lie in the results. So in comparison, for your savings and fixed deposits, the total amount you earn at the end is calculated like this:\nEarnings = 1,000,000+(1,000,000\u00d75\u00d715)\nEarnings\u00a0 = Rs 1,750,000\nConsidering that the average interest rates, given by the Nepali banks, in the savings and fixed deposits are 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nHere is what you would earn in a year for the same.\nSavingsFixed DepositRs 1000000+(1000000\u00d76\u00d71)1000000+(1000000\u00d79\u00d71)Rs 1,060,000Rs 1,090,000\nAnd, at the same rate, this is your earnings in 15 years (simple vs compound):\nSavingsSimpleCompound Earnings1,000,000+(1,000,000\u00d76\u00d715)1,000,000\u00d7(1+ 6/100)15Rs 1,900,000Rs 2,350,000\nMeanwhile\nFixed DepositSimpleCompound Earnings1,000,000+(1,000,000\u00d79\u00d715)1,000,000\u00d7(1+ 9/100)15Rs 2,282,764.24Rs 3,472,697.81\nYou can see the difference in just two years.\nFor Rs 1,000,000 with a 5 per cent interest rate for 2 years, the total earnings (principal and the interest) would be:\u00a0\nSimple Interest = Rs 1,100,000\nCompound Interest = Rs 1,102,500\nKey takeaways:\nSo why is Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) preferred?\nCAGR represents the overall growth rate of an investment, considering both positive and negative fluctuations. It provides a holistic view of how an investment has performed over time. It is often used for investments with market exposure, and the returns can be influenced by market conditions.\nAs it provides a smoothed annual growth rate, mitigating the impact of volatility and short-term fluctuations in investments, there is a more stable and realistic assessment of performance over time, with a standardised metric.\nIt applies to a wide range of investments where the value can fluctuate over time, especially in market-driven assets. It\u2019s commonly used in finance and investing to evaluate the performance of investments such as stocks, mutual funds, and portfolios. For that, understanding CAGR becomes indispensable for making informed decisions.\n ",

As the city prepares for the two-day event known as Rock Tandav, the band is ready to take the spotlight as the festival\u2019s headliner, marking their home return after a four-year break.\n\u201cWe are both excited and nervous. Can\u2019t wait to be honest,\u201d says Avishek KC, vocalist at Underside.\nIn November of last year, the band made their comeback performance after 2019 at Mahendra Independence Rock in India. However, their much-anticipated comeback show in Nepal was still pending.\nUnderside, the successful metal band from Nepal, returning to the scene has ignited excitement within the country\u2019s metal community. The announcement of their comeback has brought joy to hundreds of fans who have eagerly awaited their live performances.\nIn 2020, the band had plans to release their album and embark on world tours, but the Covid pandemic thwarted their plans. Instead, Underside redirected their focus towards Metal For Nepal, a charity project aimed at supporting impoverished communities through various initiatives such as food distribution, community aid, and ensuring children\u2019s access to education.\nDespite their involvement in Metal For Nepal over the years, music has always remained a central part of the band\u2019s identity.\n\u201cBesides Metal For Nepal, we were also making music, doing recordings and videos,\u201d says Bikrant Shrestha, guitarist at Underside.\n\n\n\nThe band\u2019s latest song Prey which was released in November 2023, is a part of their upcoming album slated to release within 2024.\u00a0According to the band, this year there will be more songs, videos and tours.\u00a0\nWith the date for their comeback show drawing near, the band is also eager to see what kind of turnout they will have in the crowd.\n\u201cMany of our regular listeners have moved abroad. So I am curious about new crowds,\u201d says Shrestha.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t even know who is following our music besides our regular listeners, many of whom are abroad.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite this, there is a palpable sense of excitement among the band members, as the prospect of an outdoor concert featuring multiple metal and rock bands after such a long time is adding to their anticipation.\n\u201cWe make sure to do a good show, expecting a good crowd. Come and feel the space,\u201d says KC.\nUnderside is known for their innovative approach to live performances, often incorporating unique elements such as body suspension and masked dancers (their own interpretation of Lakheys). Continuing this tradition, the band will showcase nearly six new songs from their upcoming albums at Rock Tandav. Additionally, the band has introduced a new member, although their identity remains undisclosed, adding another element of intrigue for the audience.\nBeyond personal journey\u00a0\nPhoto: Pexels/ Prasun Sangroula \n\u00a0As Underside prepares for the album, the band says that the songs will be different in many ways than their earlier songs.\u00a0\n\u201cLyrically, we used to write more about inward journey, personal conflict and emotion. I think this time it is bigger than us. There is a message in every song, mostly about social political issues,\u201d says KC.\nTwo songs from the album have already been released and both of them revolve around social-political issues. For instance, Gadhimai condemns the killing and abuse of animals in the name of god and Prey condemns the practice of witchcraft.\u00a0\nIn terms of sound as well, the band has gone beyond their regular style. They say they are trying to make their own identity through sound.\u00a0And they band has done that by incorporating Nepali instruments like madal, dhime, sitar, sarangi and panche baja for the upcoming songs.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is a lot more. Let\u2019s not kill all the suspense,\u201d says KC.\nThe band wants to stand out from the thousands of bands that exist in the world metal scene.\u00a0 They believe experimenting with unique styles of sound and lyrics can help them attain their purpose.\u00a0\n\u201cOur country has a lot of unique instruments, so, why don\u2019t we try them? ,\u201d says Bikash Bhujel, guitarist of the band.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we go abroad with such a unique sound, we stand out from various other bands coming from different parts of the world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe band says that it would not be favourable if people perceived their sound as similar to bands from other countries rather than recognizing their distinct identity. The band learned such things from their experience of travelling to various countries for shows.\u00a0\nFeeling fatigued by the monotony of their sound, the band started experimenting. They openly acknowledge that their earlier sound lacked the distinctiveness they possess now.\n\u201cWe all have been enjoying whatever we have been experimenting with,\u201d says KC.\u00a0\nFormed in 2011, Underside has been to local venues to big-shot festivals like Bloodstock Open Air Music Festival and Download Festival. What motivates the band for the progress is just their passion and dedication.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a thirst to gain ground. It\u2019s really hard to always remain strong. But we manage to do it, our audiences have been a great source of inspiration,\u201d says KC.\u00a0\u00a0\nPhoto: Facebook/Underside \nIn Nepal\u2019s metal scene, the spotlight often falls on the same longstanding bands that have been performing for years. Newcomers struggle to gain recognition and often fail to achieve anything significant. They seem as fleeting as mayflies in comparison to the established acts.\nThe guitarist of the band Shrestha blames the government for this.\u00a0 He says due to the lack of opportunity and better earnings, many of the musicians have gone abroad.\n\u201cThere are many musicians who went abroad for shows, but haven\u2019t returned,\u201d says Shrestha. \u201cThey have settled their life there as they saw no point in returning.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMusic is pursued purely out of passion; musicians must maintain proper jobs or businesses for sustainability,\u201d he says\nFurthermore, the dwindling charm of the metal scene is attributed to multiple factors, including the migration of audiences abroad. Although some DIY metal concerts continues to take place in the country, the overall scene has remained relatively stagnant.\nAnother contributing factor to the decline in the charm of metal music is the shifting taste among listeners. Nowadays, there is a preference for acoustic sounds over other genres, leading to a decline in the popularity of metal music. This is not just in Nepal but a world wide trend.\nA decade or so ago, metal music was at its peak. Regular shows featuring a diverse array of metal songs from various bands were commonplace, fueling a movement for the advancement of the metal scene. Senior rock figures were often seen providing significant support, fostering the growth of the metal community.\n\u201cMetal bands were not supposed to be that big. Everyone was happy with the success,\u201d says KC.\u00a0\n\u201cMetal music is still not a widely acceptable kind of music. And this has created additional challenges for the lately formed metal bands,\u201d says KC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPossibilities of Silence Festival\u00a0\nPhoto: Facebook/Underside \nApart from making music, Underside also has its music festival called Silence Festival, the first metal music festival of Nepal, where local and international artists perform. The festival is still the most anticipated festival for metalheads. Started in 2011, the festival has not taken place since 2019, which was headlined by Testament.\u00a0\nThe main reason behind its halt, according to Shrestha, is financial issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe major sponsors of the festival used to be alcohol brands, but after the government banned the sponsorship of alcohol in public shows, no other product or company was ready to sponsor the show, says Shrestha.\u00a0Similarly, the unnecessary lobbying to authority to run a show is another thing that has discouraged the organisers.\n\u201cWe do silence festivals for the betterment of the Nepali music community, \u201d says Shrestha. \u201cWe do not earn profit from it.\u201d\nHe further says they have spent a lot for the festival, and now it is hard to afford the festival without the proper support of the government.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the government collaborates with the festival, the festival will be massive,\u201d says Shrestha.\n ",

    "230": "\nPhoto by Nathan Cima on Unsplash\nBy the end of November 2023, winter had already started in Gadhawa of Dang district. After travelling miles in the village area, we reached the house of 80-year-old Kanhaiyalal Yadav. There were some huts, haystacks, and barns with buffaloes tied in the courtyard, and two cows were in the shed. In the family, all members who can work are devoted to the care of the buffaloes. The men milked the buffaloes, while the women cooked and cleaned the pantry.\nThat morning, in Parnaha in Gadhawa rural municipality 6, Kanhaiyalal went ahead to milk the buffalo with a bucket. Maybe because the buffalo saw a new face, the milking ended earlier than usual. \n\u201cNow the calf will eat the rest,\u201d said Kanhaiyalal, showing half a bucket of milk.\nHis elder son, Anurag Yadav, 62, and nephew, Lal Bahadur, 31, were already milking buffaloes. Even before the sunlight broke through the morning fog, they had finished milking the buffaloes, fetching water for them, and even collecting grass and hay for them to feed on.\nAfter completing their tasks, they sat down to drink tea. Around half past seven, Lal Bahadur collected the milk in the cans and rode towards the dairy on a motorcycle.\nWhile sipping tea in the courtyard, Kanhaiyalal called his wife, Chhatrapati Yadav, to bring a bell. Waiting, he said, \u201cIt was not like this before. By this time, these buffaloes would have gone to the forest.\u201d\u00a0\nSitting on a chair, he held up the iron bell, which he could hardly fit in his fist, and reminisced, \u201cAfter we finished eating in the morning, we would head to the forest, searching for the herd of buffaloes, listening to the sound of bells hanging around their necks.\u201d\nNow, however, with no place for the buffalos to graze and a lack of water in the rivers, they just take the buffalos out on a stroll.\n\u201cThis bell is useless now,\u201d he said.\nTimes are changing\n\nKanhaiyalal of Gadhawa has witnessed wholesale changes when it comes to buffalo rearing in the village. The bell, now collecting dust in one corner of Kanhaiyalal\u2019s house, is not only a symbol of his ancestral profession but also a witness to the changes he has seen along the way. \nAs times change, questions arise about how long the Yadav community, considered descendants of the Mahishpal dynasty, will continue their traditional livelihood of rearing buffaloes. For Kanhaiyalal, the bell serves as a constant reminder of this perplexing question.\nBuffalo rearing is facing a crisis not only in Dang but also across Nepal. This is thanks to rapid urbanisation, changing lifestyles, the youth not being interested and lack of grazing area and water resources. The Yadav community in Dang is currently grappling with an environmental crisis as water sources such as forests, streams, rivers, and ponds in the Terai region are being destroyed.\nDespite the looming threat, they have been unable to find any study or data that could explain the decreasing number in their profession. However, during the field study conducted for this report, we observed that they have undoubtedly been affected by changes in the environment and the exploitation of natural resources.\nThe experience of three generations of some families in Gadhawa and Rajpur rural municipalities of Dang, where the Yadav community is predominantly settled, indicates that traditional animal husbandry has been facing a crisis for the past few years. And the data also corroborates this.\nThe concerning issue is that the elderly here are worried that this profession will vanish in a few years, while the youth are seeking alternatives. However, at the three tiers of government and the community level, there are no new programmes or public awareness initiatives to address the issue.\nThe harrowing data\nAccording to the National Agriculture Census 2021/22, over the last 10 years, the number of farmer families rearing buffaloes and cattle across the country has decreased from 1,669,000 to 1,417,000. Similarly, the total number of buffaloes and cattle has also decreased. According to the 2011/12 census, there were 3,174,000 buffaloes and cattle in the country, but by 2021/22, this number had dropped to 2,923,000.\nLocals say the number of livestock is decreasing due to the shrinking of grazing areas and rivers being encroached upon in many places.\u00a0\nKanhaiyalal, who grew up watching his father Kallu Yadav graze buffaloes, took over the reins. Following suit, his son Anurag and other family members have supported him. However, the number of buffaloes has continued to decrease. \n\u201cDuring my father\u2019s time, we had around 100 buffaloes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we only have 20. I know this number will go down in the coming years.\u201d\nResearchers say that seasonal activities directly impact agriculture and animal husbandry. According to Hemu Kafle, a scientist who has been studying the effects of drought on agriculture, the alteration in rainfall patterns during monsoons and winters is affecting village wells, rice fields, and feeding ponds.\n\u201cSmall ponds used to be a common sight in the fields of Tarai. Now, there are very few,\u201d Kafle said. Chandra Kishore, an independent journalist working in the region, agrees with Kafle and says the water levels have also gone down in many ponds and streams.\n\u201cThese buffaloes need water. People use ground water to cool them off but it is not the same and buffaloes sense that,\u201d said Chandra Kishore.\nBack at Kanhaiyalal\u2019s home, the family is preparing to take the buffaloes out to graze. As he cannot do it due to his old age, Kanhaiyalal takes his nephew Lal Bahadur\u2019s help.\nAfter a while, Lal Bahadur began loosening the rope around the buffaloes, with Kanhaiyalal following slowly behind. About 100 meters south, they reached the Sikrahawa River. Standing on the riverbank, Kanhaiyalal remembered how the buffaloes used to enjoy themselves in the river 10 years ago. But now, there was only ankle-deep water in the river, running slightly to one side, infested with algae.\nOnce in the water, some of the buffaloes started playing while others drank from the river, however little was left there. Lal Bahadur began bathing the buffalo near the bridge, where the water level was slightly higher. Splashing the water with his hands, he bathed the buffaloes. After a while, the buffaloes stood up and moved on.\nLal Bahadur walked behind him, picked up the slippers he had taken off, and started shouting \u2018rah rah\u2019 and \u2018jha jha\u2019 (a local way to guide the buffaloes while they graze and roam) with a stick in his hand. His knees were damp with the water, to which he adds, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t come to this place even five years ago. The buffaloes would play in the water themselves, and we would swim in this river.\u201d\nAlong with Lal Bahadur, buffaloes from other houses in the village also climbed up from the river and left the road. Gwalas (buffalo shepherds) were walking with their herds of buffaloes. Guiding and guarding the mustard fields in the nearby houses from the buffaloes, they reached the Sikrahwa River, which is about 500 meters to the north (both rivers that join the Rapti are named Sikrahwa).\nThe buffalo roamed around the riverbanks between the two bridges, about one kilometre apart. Around four in the afternoon, Lal Bahadur brought the buffalo home. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for today. This is the current way buffaloes go around,\u201d he said.\nThe shrinking fields\n\nWater and forests are indispensable for rearing buffaloes. However, due to increasing urbanisation and exploitation of natural resources, the grazing areas for buffaloes are shrinking. Simultaneously, the time for buffaloes to roam around in a clean environment and roam/ play in the water is also decreasing.\u00a0\nKanhaiyalal, a witness to the village\u2019s transformation before his eyes, says, \u201cThe once rivers and forests are now settlements, so where can the grass grow? Where is the grazing area?\u201d He leaves the question hanging and walks along the road to return home.\nThe condition of all seven families in that village who reared buffaloes is the same. Devraj Yadav, 36, from another village of Parnaha, used to go buffalo grazing with his grandfather. Now, his father Gurudayal Yadav, 72 is overseeing the grazing for buffaloes.\n\u201cPreviously, our cattle rearing relied entirely on grazing. However, raising buffaloes solely through grazing is no longer feasible; now, grass and straw must be provided at home,\u201d said Devraj adding that this has been the case for the past decade.\nRecalling how he used to travel within a five-kilometre radius to feed buffaloes all day, he says that now they are taken no more than two kilometres away, and only for grazing. Due to the shrinking of water and grazing areas, the farmers here are compelled to raise livestock at home.\nHe also recounts that not only did they have to go far in search of the river for water, but they also had to take the buffalo to Rapti further than before. \u201cSome 20-25 years ago, buffaloes were taken to Rapti only after April/May, but now they must be taken at the end of February. Kakrahwa River dries up around January/February.\u201d\nThis is why many families have started to set up water pumps, which cost around Rs 25,000. However, that too is not a viable option as the area also suffers from underground water scarcity.\nTaking care of buffaloes\n\nA buffalo needs at least 70 litres of water a day, for which they depend on the water pumps.\n\u201cWe could also do farming without bore water. It rained well during the rainy season. It seems that there is less rain now. On top of that, the settlement grew, and the water is drying up,\u201d Devraj said.\nLocated on the route from Gadhawa towards the southern Nepal-Indian border, in Rajpur Rural Municipality 4, is the Khardaria village. Each household here has around 100 buffaloes, and the majority of women\u2019s time is spent providing water and grass to the buffaloes.\nAnjana Yadav, who tends to 150 buffaloes, was about to go and cut grass in the afternoon.\nTwo women were drawing water while seated on a log positioned above the well. Anjana\u2019s neighbour was coming to fetch another bucket of water for her house. \u201cAt least seven family members and over 400 buffaloes rely on this well, This is the water that sustains the buffaloes; we drink it too,\u201d she said.\nSince their livelihood is based on buffalo rearing and farming, and they are not only concerned about water; it takes a whole day to collect a heavy load of grass. \n\u201cWe go to that lake to gather a heavy load of grass,\u201d she said, pointing to the forest of the Mahabharata hills, which is connected to the Indian border in the south. They leave at 8 am and return at 5 pm carrying a heavy load of grass (about 50/60 kg).\nSohan Sah, who has been studying the social and economic conditions of Tarai residents, says that this has a direct impact on human productivity as well as the possibility of advancement of economically backward communities.\n\u201cIf they spend the day gathering heavy grass, their productivity is limited to that task,\u201d says Sah, a researcher at Martin Chautari, \u201cIf so, the standard of living can be raised, and productivity will also increase.\nNo targeted programme\n\nThe local government is yet to introduce a programme targeting this community. Since last year, the Small Farmers and Youth Entrepreneurship Partnership Project has been running in Rajpur and Gadhawa rural municipalities in collaboration with Heifer International.\u00a0\nThe cost of this program, which will run for 42 months, is Rs 62 million per municipality, with 70 percent of the investment coming from the municipality.\nYam Narayan Pokharel, chairman of Gadhawa rural municipality, claimed that through this programme the shed waste management and advanced seeds are being looked at. \n\u201cBut there is no targeted programme for the Yadav community,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, in Rajpur rural municipality, Yadavs have been targeted and assisted under the programme, said Dhanpatidevi Yadav, deputy chair of the municipality. \n\u201cIt is incorrect that buffalo-rearing farmers are not included in the programme carried out in conjunction with Heifer,\u201d she said regarding the complaints of farmers from the Yadav community, \u201cAlongside goat rearing, we have also supported the improvement of buffalo sheds.\u201d\nThe Yadav community, traditionally vegetarian and not involved in goat or chicken farming, comprises the majority of Rajpur and Gadhawa rural municipalities. The locals are displeased that the programme has been introduced specifically for agriculture and animal husbandry. The partnership programme initially focused on goat rearing. However, considering the farmers\u2019 needs, the livestock improvement programme was also partially included, said Mahesh Acharya, Senior Program Officer of Heifer.\nBoth municipalities have distributed advanced varieties of grass seeds to set water pumps for farmers and address the grass problem. \u201cThese programmes were not designed specifically for the Yadav community, but they are also included,\u201d said Gadhawa chair Pokharel.\nAnurag Yadav, a farmer from Gadhawa Parnaha, alleges that the municipality provides water pumps, road improvements, and high-grade seeds to people they know rather than to those with actual needs. However, he also acknowledged to avoid repeating past mistakes, they have formed a farmers\u2019 group, and support is now provided solely based on the group\u2019s recommendations.\nKanhaiyalal, a prominent farmer well-versed in the recurring tale of accusations and defences, glanced at the buffalo and remarked to us, \u201cIf my lalabalas (referring to his buffaloes as children) cease to exist, what becomes of our identity?\u201d While identity pertains to the livelihood of the Yadav community intertwined with animal husbandry. Despite assertions from the rural municipality regarding improvement in the situation, there are no discernible signs of such progress in the lives of local farmers.\n(Prepared in collaboration with Center for Data Journalism Nepal and Earth Journalism Network, alongside Dasharath Ghimire, Dang.)\n ",

But while they shared an aircraft, their reasons to be in Dubai were entirely different. The dignitaries were travelling to negotiate climate change mitigation with world leaders, whereas Prem was leaving his home because the climate has already changed too much. \nPrem is from Bardiya district in midwestern Nepal\u2019s Lumbini province, where communities have long faced drawn-out droughts during the monsoon and winter seasons, and heavy rains at harvest time.\nPrem is one of thousands of Nepali economic migrants who find employment in the Gulf. \u201cMy daughter was just a one-year-old baby when I came here [to the UAE] for the first time.

Now he works as a helper in a vehicle repair shop in Al Barsha, Dubai.\n\u201cI want to stay with my family and find livelihood in agriculture,\u201d continues Prem. \u201cBut these days, weather patterns are not in our favour; agriculture is in a declining trend. How can I stay home?\u201d\nThough economic migration is a decades-old phenomenon in Nepal, researchers say that in recent years, extreme weather events and climate change-induced disasters are adding to the factors pushing people out of the country.\n\u201cThe\u00a0reasons\u00a0[for Nepalis] to go to foreign countries are socio-economic conditions and a lack of employment opportunities here in Nepal,\u201d says Amina Maharjan, a migration specialist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. \u201cLately, however, we are seeing people choose labour or educational migration as an adaptive measure to post-disaster economic burdens.\u201d\nMaharjan\u2019s conclusions are mirrored by a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0by Equidem, a human rights and labour rights non-profit: \u201cMigrant workers interviewed by Equidem migrated for employment to the UAE from the Philippines, Mozambique, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal \u2013 five of the ten countries most affected by climate change between 2000 and 2019.\u201d\nThe climate factor\nHouses are seen submerged in a flood in Melamchi Bazaar of Sindhupalchok, on Wednesday, June 16, 2021. Photo: Bikas Shrestha\nSunder Pandit, 26, now lives in Sydney, Australia. But he often wonders where he would be today if the massive flash flood on Nepal\u2019s Melamchi River had not occurred in June 2021. The disaster claimed at least\u00a017 lives\u00a0and swept away infrastructure and hundreds of houses.\n\u201cThat flood pushed me to choose migration in the name of education, but it is not what I wanted or dreamed of,\u201d says Pandit. \u201cThe flood swept away our newly established hospitality business and trout farm, where we had invested around Rs 8 million [USD 60,300] by taking loans.\u201d\nThe Melamchi flood originated in eastern Nepal\u2019s rural Helambu region, where scores of homes were\u00a0destroyed. One of them belonged to Pandit and his family.\nPandit was fresh out of college, where he studied hospitality management. He had finished an internship in China and was working in a Nepali tourism hotspot, the city of Pokhara, to gain experience. He then returned home to the Sindhupalchok\u00a0municipality where he launched the\u00a0Helambu Riverside Resort\u00a0with his brother, in their village of Chanaute.\n\u201cEverything was going great; we were using local products, and the fish farm was also there,\u201d Pandit says. \u201cWithin a year, our business took off and already provided employment to 12 locals. But at a time when we were planning to go big, the flood hit hard, and I ended up here.\u201d\nIn 2021, the environment department published its latest vulnerability and risk\u00a0assessment. It categorises Sindhupalchok as a \u201chigh-impact\u201d area when it comes to climate-induced disasters, while\u00a0reports\u00a0suggest the 2021 Melamchi flood was climate-induced. \u201cThe Melamchi flood pushed us out from our village,\u201d Pandit says.\nThirty five migrant workers were interviewed by The Third Pole for this report. One of them is 50-year-old Ram Bindo Yadav, who was waiting for a bus from Kathmandu\u2019s main airport to his village in Siraha district on a late January afternoon. He used to farm on rented land, \u201cbut in recent years, farming became difficult; there is no irrigation, and we don\u2019t get rainfall when it is needed.\u201d\nRam Bindo was returning from Qatar and one of many migrant workers catching a bus home. Bhuran Yadav, 43, came forward to share his story: \u201cMy family\u2019s livelihood depends on agriculture. Uncertain rainfall and frequent droughts in the monsoon season and winter are some of the main reasons I went to Qatar.\u201d\nBhuran Yadav\u2019s village is in south-eastern Nepal\u2019s Shahidnagar municipality, Dhanusha district, where most depend on agriculture. \u201cBecause of this, almost every household has at least one member in a Gulf country,\u201d he adds.\nDhanusha and Siraha are\u00a0both\u00a0highly vulnerable when it comes to climate-induced disasters. They are situated in the Tarai plains that run between the Himalayas and Nepal\u2019s southern border, which are\u00a0witnessing\u00a0back-to-back droughts. And at other times, prolonged,\u00a0unseasonal\u00a0rains are destroying harvests.\nFrom farm to foreign land\nNepali migrant workers.\nAccording to the environment department\u2019s aforementioned 2021 vulnerability and risk\u00a0assessment, natural hazards (mainly floods and landslides) are one of the major driving forces behind economic migration in Nepal: \u201cThe majority of the labour force depends on agriculture and this sector is badly impacted by recurrent floods, droughts, and landslides. As a result, the agricultural labour force, particularly the young, tends to move away from the agriculture sector and explore employment opportunities in the service sector and labour market outside of the country.\u201d\nWe spoke to the migration researcher and National Network for Safe Migration president, Chiranjivi Baral. He agrees that \u2013 alongside other socioeconomic factors \u2013 climate change-induced disasters are forcing people to choose labour migration.\n\u201cWe were talking with sheep herders in Mustang [in northern Nepal], and they said their friends are in the Gulf who used to work in pastureland,\u201d Baral recalls. \u201cAccording to them, the reason was the impact of not having enough snow and rain.\u201d\nMost farmers, from the mountains to the southern plains of Terai, are experiencing the impacts of a changing climate in their day-to-day lives. Findings from the 2021 national agricultural census\u00a0support\u00a0this: of the farming families who know about climate change, 91 per cent said it impacted their agricultural activities, of which 85% said it decreased their yields.\nBut Prem from Bardiya still wishes to return home to make his living. \u201cFarming is what we did as a source of livelihood there, and I have hope that there will be a way to make it happen again, because I want to spend time seeing my daughter grow,\u201d he says, on the phone from Dubai.\nThis story\u00a0first appeared on The Third Pole\u00a0and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under the Creative Commons licence.\n ",

Unfortunately, this discrimination persists to some extent even today in countries like Nepal, where women are denied access to education, excluded from household decision-making, and offered limited leadership opportunities in organizations.\nOne hundred and fifteen years ago, the movement of women textile workers in the United States demanding equal wages and other benefits expanded to focus on achieving women\u2019s political rights. Today, this movement has evolved beyond various stages of struggle and interaction, now encompassing issues related to intersexuality and diverse sexualities. It is not merely a concern of the privileged; it is about the rights, struggles, and existence of women from marginalised classes and communities.\nIn this context, the sense of womanhood extends beyond just the pursuit of equality; it is now a constitutionally guaranteed right, as seen in Nepal. Gender rights are ensured through coexistence and the mandatory inclusion and ideological cooperation of women in all sectors of society.\nKeeping that in mind, on the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day, Onlinekhabar wants to celebrate those who challenged the patriarchy and broke the shackles to do influential things in life. Today, we want to bring attention to the significant presence of women in Nepali politics, society, culture, sports, academics, and beyond.\nTo compile a comprehensive list, our newsroom colleagues, various stakeholders, and sources have collaborated, gathering suggestions from individuals across different levels of government, including the province, district, municipality, and diaspora communities.\nThe preliminary list, comprising over a hundred names, was then submitted to the selection committee for their evaluation. Their deliberations and recommendations have led to the publication of the final list of 50 influential women.\nIt is important to clarify that \u2018influential\u2019 in this context does not solely denote women who wield power. Rather, the final selection reflects individuals who demonstrate the capacity to overcome obstacles, showcase talent, and continually strive for new accomplishments through their dedication and perseverance.\nThis initiative is not aimed at any particular group or class; rather, it seeks to represent every unit of Nepali society. We are proud to announce the 50 names selected among our esteemed readers, reflecting our first attempt at this endeavour.\nWhile we tried to include important contributors, we acknowledge that some individuals may have been left out due to various factors such as unavailability. We recognise the many women whose contributions could not be included in this list, despite their significant efforts and struggles. Their importance is undeniable, and we appreciate the role played by every woman striving for change.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to representing diverse voices and experiences in our news content, ideological articles, interviews, and other platforms. We welcome constructive suggestions, feedback, and criticism as we continue to refine and expand our efforts to celebrate and uplift the contributions of women in Nepali society.\nThis is only the start, as we aim to do this every year honouring the women who play an important role in our society by proving to be influential figures for the forthcoming generation.\nLet us embark together on the journey towards equality and coexistence, ensuring that every day can be like March 8\u2014a day of celebration and recognition of the contributions of women in our society.

Operating an orphanage in Janakpur, Sah relentlessly looks after abandoned children as if they were her own. There are days she barely gets enough sleep but that does not deter her as she selflessly looks after the children. Her day starts with them and ends with the 13 children that she is looking after at the orphanage.\u00a0\nSah\u2019s transformation from Meera to mother Meera came in July 2005 when an English professor Satyanarayan Mahato \u2018Alok\u2019 asked her to take care of a child he had found on the roadside. Mahato had gone through a lot to save the child and asked Meera, who came to his ashram regularly, to look after her. The mother in Meera could not say no and the rest is history.\u00a0\nSince then, every time a baby is abandoned, they are taken to the ashram where Mother Meera welcomes them with open arms. The ashram has transformed into a shelter for children who survived attempted abortions, those who were abandoned due to social and economic circumstances, and those who were discarded for any other reason.\nNow, as she nears her twilight years, all Sah wants is to see these 13 children thrive in life.

For much of their history, the community lived a nomadic lifestyle. But things are changing and in the forefront of the change is one Santoshi Bankariya. Under her leadership, the community has started to run a homestay and even set up a soap factory.\u00a0\nThe only second person to pass SEE, she understood the importance education had on her life. This is why, along with the homestay and soap factory, she also stressed providing tuition service to the young boys of girls of the community. She also extended the tuition classes to adults. Since these classes, six others have passed SEE.\nEven though she completed her high school as a junior technical assistant (Pre-Diploma in Agriculture), she decided to stay with the community. She started training them to grow produce that would no longer force them to go into the forest for food. Now the challenge is to get land from the government and vows to fight for that right until her last breath.\n\nPragati Rai \u2013 Writer\nPragati Rai \nWhat does a writer need to write? A pen, notebook, or a laptop? Well, for Pragati Rai, her determination was enough to kickstart her writing career. It was her sheer will that compelled finish what she started working as a school teacher in Kathmandu. Her dream of becoming a writer hit a speedbreaker when a manuscript she was working on was deleted from the shared computer at school. Life took her to South Korea and life got busy and writing came to a halt.\nA little push then forcer her to get back into writing. She remembered why she wanted to write as a young girl and got back into it. Her first novel, Lekhak ki Swasni (A Writer\u2019s Wife) tells her story and how her life was interconnected with her husband Rajan Mukarung. It was penned out of frustration having had to endure a flawed relationship with her husband. The writer\u2019s wife officially transformed into a writer.\nDespite her success, some people questioned whether Rai herself had written the book, with some even suggesting that it was her husband who had penned it instead. However, such doubts have not deterred her, and she has emerged as one of the best storytellers in Nepal. Her works like Birsieko Mrityu and Thangra have also been well-received.\nRai believes that although Nepali literature continues to evolve from various perspectives, women still struggle to share their stories. Many women across different castes, cultures, and regions share common experiences of suffering, yet their unique struggles often go untold. These stories cannot be adequately expressed solely through the narratives of others. Hence, the stories of women from marginalised areas and communities in Nepal remain largely unwritten. Rai says there is a need for women to start telling their own stories, empowering them to voice their experiences and perspectives.\n\nRanju Yadav \u2013 Artist\nRanju Yadav \nFor Mithila artist Ranju Yadav, art is more than a means to express herself, it is a medium through which can tell stories of the evils in society. A national award winner, Yadav has been involved in Mithila art for over a decade and since the start has used it as a platform to call for change. Her art revolves around issues like child marriage, female feticide, dowry, untouchability and gender-based violence.\nShe feels content with her work in the folk art style, not just because it allows her to express her voice against harmful social practices, but also because her art has been instrumental in creating positive change in society. Yadav has observed that her artwork effectively raises awareness among people.\n\nSumana Shrestha \u2013 Politician\nSumana Shrestha \nSumana Shrestha had no particular interest in politics until she became a lawmaker. Now that she is here, she is making a major mark through her call for new policing and voicing opinions against the status quo.\u00a0\nShrestha often says she entered politics out of frustration. She is not like the politicians from the 90s; she is a breath of fresh air. Many even say that Shrestha is unfamiliar with Nepali politics. However, ever since she was nominated to be a member of the House of Representatives through proportional representation, there is an argument she has done more than many lawmakers who were directly elected.\nHighly opinionated, she speaks with facts in hand and has shown the important role the parliamentary committees play. She is part of the education committee and says she is interested in working in areas related to IT education and job creation. Shrestha can also be seen focused on fulfilling her duties as a member of Parliament, which operates on taxpayers\u2019 money. She believes that lawmakers\u2019 inability to effectively carry out their responsibilities amounts to nothing less than corruption.\n\nDawa Yangzum Sherpa \u2013 Mountaineer\nDawa Yangzum Sherpa\nWhen Dawa Yangzum Sherpa told her family that she wanted to become a mountaineer, everyone took it as a joke. Even though a lot of men in her village went on expeditions to Everest, for a woman to even think about doing that was far-fetched.\nFast-forward 20 years, Sherpa has become one of Nepal\u2019s leading female mountain guides and a sponsored athlete by North Face and Rolex. But that is not all; she has also successfully climbed 13 out of the 14 8,000-meter mountains, with just one mountain remaining to achieve the remarkable feat of being the first Nepali to climb all 14 8,000-meter peaks.\nShe is also the first woman in Asia to become an International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA) guide. Over the past few years, Sherpa has been helping young girls who also dream of climbing mountains like her. Every year, she takes time out to take them climbing or trekking around Khumbu or Rolwaling.\n\nSunmaya Budha \u2013 Trail runner/ultra runner\nSunmaya Budha\nSunmaya Budha was on the verge of getting married off by her parents when she was in her early teens. Things were almost certain but she ran away and established herself as one of the top trail runners in Nepal.\nWith a never-say-die attitude and an ego to prove her doubters wrong, Buddha has created history by becoming the first Nepali woman to win various races across the globe including The North Face 100 Hong Kong, Translantau by UTMB and Golden 100 Hong Kong.\u00a0\nIn 2022, she even finished second in one of the toughest trail races in the world, the UTMB Mont Blanc \u2013 CCC, etching her name in the history books. Trained by Olympian Hari Bahadur Rokaya, Buddha has come a long way as she now is part of the North Face Adventure Team which looks after her training.\u00a0\n\nSabitra Bhandari \u2013 Footballer\nSabitra Bhandari \nSabitra Bhandari, popularly known as Samba is one of the most successful sportspersons in Nepal. She is a marvel in Nepali football who, since her debut in 2014, has taken Nepali football by storm.\nComing from a humble background, Bhandari developed a keen interest in football from a young age. But little did she know that her fondness would one day take her to the peak of Nepali football.\nRecently, Bhandari scored her 50th international goal for Nepal. She is the first footballer in the country to do so. She also ticked off another first as she became the first Nepali to score in a major European league as she scored for En Avant Guingamp against Lille on March 2. On June 13 last year,\u00a0 Bhandari signed to play for an Israeli club Hapoel Raanana Women\u2019s FC in the Israeli Women\u2019s League \u2018Ligat Nashim\u2019.\u00a0\n\nShilshila Acharya \u2013 Entrepreneur and climate activist\nShilshila Acharya\nAlmost every student who does well academically in their school and high school opts to become either a doctor or an engineer. But Shilshilia Acharya, who despite getting a government scholarship to study MBBS, decided to study environmental science. Many questioned her decision to leave behind a career in medical science to pursue one in environmental science. However, Acharya remained in her choice, believing that high-achieving students should not feel compelled to follow conventional paths and instead should explore subjects that resonate with their passions and values.\nHer pursuit of excellence took her to Norway where she completed her master\u2019s degree. The Scandinavian country offered insights into the functionality of socialism and women empowerment, highlighting its differences with its application in Nepal. Thus, she returned with the hope of creating change in Nepal. After her return, you could often see her in the street demanding action against issues of climate change and women\u2019s rights.\nThe founder and director of Avni Ventures, Acharya has made a career in mitigating the causes of climate change. Through various projects, she and Avni focus on making people aware of the impact caused by climate change and training the youth along with women on its mitigation.\nRecognising plastic as a primary contributor to pollution, she initiated a campaign aimed at curtailing its usage, which has gained significant momentum. Kathmandu has now fully prohibited the use of single-use plastic below 40 microns. Moreover, after encountering young women coerced into the sex trade, Acharya launched an initiative to empower and rehabilitate them.\nNow she hopes what she has done in Kathmandu with waste management can be replicated in other local levels in Nepal. She believes climate change is a major problem and a pressing issue for human survival.\u00a0\n\nKrishni Tharu \u2013 Politician\nKrishni Tharu\nKrishni Tharu is a woman who has, for most of her life, shown utmost resilience. A former Kamlari, an indentured girl child labourer, from the Tharu community, she has risen to become a voice of change in Nepal.\u00a0\nAfter 18 years as a Kamlari and Brukeni, she actively advocated against Kamaiya/Kamlari practices and led protests realising the need to break free from slavery. That journey led her to become the national chairperson of Kamaiya Mahila Jagaran Samaj and work for the rights and welfare of the freed Kamaiyas.\nDespite facing hardships and societal stigma, she persisted, advocating for education, employment, and empowerment of women and marginalised communities. She never received a formal education. However, it did not discourage her from learning to read and write in Nepali and English by enrolling herself in an adult literacy class. Now she effectively convenes assembly meetings and is known for her zeal to encourage the participation of women in politics and judicial and legal services.\u00a0\nHer determination and willingness to create change caught the eyes of the UML who then nominated her to become a member of the Lumbini Provincial Assembly and even made her the deputy speaker.\n\nMohanmaya Dhakal \u2013 Politician\nMohanmaya Dhakal\nMohanmaya Dhakal is out to prove to the entire country how capable women can be when given the chance at leadership positions. Dhakal is the mayor of Birendranagar Municipality in Karnali. After proving herself as a deputy mayor, Dhakal was asked to run for mayor by the people of Birendranagar.\nHer career in politics started as early as when she was 14 years old. Since then, there has been no stopping her as she has often been the voice of change in party meetings within the province and at the central level.\nNow a central committee member of the UML, she aims to make Birendranagar safe for women and children as she believes that a city like that will be safe for everyone. Several programmes aimed at women\u2019s health, maternal safety, daughters\u2019 birth savings accounts, women\u2019s self-employment, and support for women farmers, among others, are currently operational under the mayor\u2019s leadership, encompassing more than a dozen initiatives dedicated to empowering women.\nIn addition to these initiatives, free sanitary pads distribution for women, a free ambulance service for pregnant women, and a free video x-ray programme have been implemented, all of which are touted to be highly effective. Notably, some of these programs were initiated during her tenure as deputy mayor.\nWith the aim of setting up Birendranagar as an education hub, Dhakal and her municipality have also initiated a 10-year plan that focuses on curriculum development, teacher management, and community empowerment. That is not all, in her leadership, the municipality has also aimed to solve the drinking water issue by lifting water from the Bheri river and has earned recognition as the country\u2019s best municipality for environmental efforts.\n\nSangita Chepang \u2013 Activist and politician\nSangita Chepang\nSangita Chepang, a female ward member in Gajuri Rural Municipality Ward 6 of Dhading, has been re-elected for her second term. Hailing from Gajuri-6, Syangmaidanda, Chepang has dedicated her life to uplifting the marginalised Chepang community in Nepal. This is why she is known beyond the small borders of her ward.\nGrowing up, she always felt the Chepang community were discriminated against and wanted to do something that would end that. She started calling for the community to have their own forest and water supply system. Slowly, her voice grew larger and that paved the way for her to get into politics.\nEven before she got into politics, she led the way as a leader as she was a major person who called on the community to save their forest. Everyone, including her own people, ridiculed her. They asked how one woman save a forest could. But gradually, things changed. Women in her community stopped instigating wildfires and initiated an afforestation campaign.\nShe also played a major role in the village getting access to water. There was a time when women had to queue up for hours for water but now every household in her village has a tap and that is all thanks to a determined Chepang who did not take no for an answer.\n\nDr Banira Karki \u2013 Doctor\nDr Banira Karki \nDr Banira Karki never liked people doubting her. Established as one of the finest breast onco-surgeons in the country, Karki had to smash patriarchy to get to where she is today. Spending years away from Nepal, she was always inclined to get back to Nepal and give back.\nEver since she joined med school, she always wanted to become a surgeon. As years passed by she saw how women were suffering from breast cancer after which she became a specialist in breast surgery.\nRecently, many new techniques have been introduced to treat breast cancer. With the help of new technology, Karki has brought laughter and smiles to the faces of many women who do not have to remove their breasts altogether.\nThis is the message she is trying to portray recently. She says women no longer need to feel anxious as Nepal now has the skills and technology to treat breast cancer effectively. She also has been pushing women to restart their lives after cancer. She can often be heard motivating women who may have lost hope in life to rise and embrace it once again.\n\nMiruna Magar \u2013 Actor\nMiruna Magar \nAs a majority of youth leave Nepal for the riches and grandeur of abroad, some come back to Nepal aiming to leave a mark in the country. One such person is Miruna Magar. Born in Hong Kong and brought up in the United Kingdom, Magar has, over the past few years, left a major mark in the Nepali film industry. This can be seen from her back-to-back super hits in Jaari and Kabaddi 4.\nThe indigenous community along with many Nepali women seems to have embraced Magar. Most women see themselves in the characters she plays. It is safe to say, she has touched the lives of many in her short film career. Her professionalism and hard work have also set her apart, say directors who have worked with her.\nA researcher, Magar, has seen Nepal and now wants to make films based on women.

Yet she has the ability to carry a film. Whether portraying Aarti Aama, Heera Bulaaki, or a rebellious character in Bahaab, Panta has shouldered the weight of these films with finesse.\nHer peers call her a method actor; someone who can easily adapt to the role given to her. She\u2019s disciplined and extremely hardworking. How? If she has to play a certain role, she spends as much time with these women as possible. For Bulaki, she spent months in Sudurpaschim to give justice to the role she was playing. During Julebi, she was seen spending time with sex workers in Kathmandu getting to know them and their trade.\nPanta has filled the void present for female actresses in mainstream Nepali cinema. As an artist, she thrives on playing different characters, constantly seeking to experience different lives through her craft. Notably, she made history as the first Nepali actress to grace the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. Her participation was in the representation of her role in the Italian movie The Eight Mountains, marking a significant milestone in her career.\n\nRubina Chhetry Belbase \u2013 Cricketer\nRubina Chhetry Belbase\nFor a little over a decade, Rubina Chhetry Belbase has demonstrated exceptional leadership in Nepali cricket.

Poudel defies this trend as the CEO of Himalayan Re-Insurance. In her role, she spearheads the management and leadership of reinsurance, navigating the international market to promote Nepal and drive business growth. Despite coming from an educated background, Poudel stands out as one of the few women to achieve remarkable success at a young age.\nWith over a decade of professional experience in the insurance and telecom industries across the Indian and Nepali markets, Poudel has proven her capabilities in both countries. She notably served as the CEO of United Insurance, a non-life insurance company in Nepal, where she showcased exceptional leadership. Before this, she held various leadership positions in marketing, strategy, product development, underwriting, and technology departments at renowned Indian market giants such as Vodafone, ICICI Lombard, and Bharti AXA General Insurance.\n\nNamrata Baral (Nami) \u2013 Entrepreneur/Innovator\nNamrata Baral (Nami)\nHaving received a full scholarship to study medicine from Havard University Namrata Baral had a sudden change of heart and started studying economics and mathematics at the university. Her career in finance started there and she has not looked back since.\nWorking as an investment banker, Baral soon invested in a start-up company and created MoPub, a mobile ad platform allowing app developers to monetise their applications.

But through her organisation\u2019s initiative, a bill to amend the Act on Commission on Investigation of. Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation, 2014, became more victim-friendly. Her contribution to crafting laws for justice has been recognised, offering hope for recognition, justice, compensation and relief for women survivors of conflict.\nDevi Khadka\u2019s unwavering commitment and courage have brought the sufferings to the forefront and paved the way for a dignified and just future.

She was moved when she saw a tied-up, dirty boy, covered in faeces, in a squatter area. Deeply bothered by the scene, she began contemplating the necessity of caring for such children.\nBorn in Baiteshwor rural municipality of Dolakha, Upreti\u2019s family believed that their daughter should be educated and empowered. So she got the opportunity to study.

Her journey garnered significant attention in Nepal for several reasons. Firstly, being Nepali, she represented her homeland proudly on an international platform. Secondly, Poudel cannot see. Thirdly, rather than seeking sympathy, she captivated audiences with her mesmerising voice, commanding attention and admiration through the sheer beauty of her melodies.\nShe does not like it when people feel sorry for her. She believes she is capable of doing most things and does not give up. That is why she jumped from one singing reality show to another as she was adamant about making a mark in the music scene. Now, having touched the hearts of Nepalis and Indians, Poudel is aiming to touch the hearts of people throughout the world.\n\nShanti Lama \u2013 Civil service officer\nShanti Lama\nShanti Lama is the Chief Administrative Officer in a village called Sarkegad.

Even though the village office has a clock that says it\u2019s open from 10 to 5, Lama works around the clock to help the people there.\nLama had a tough childhood as she grew up when the civil war in Nepal at brewing. Her dad got arrested, and her family faced many problems\u2013from threats to her mother and grandmother to depriving them of basic needs. But after the war stopped, her dad came home, and that\u2019s when she started dreaming big.\nLama first wanted to be a teacher, then got interested in journalism, and finally became a government worker. Her job is not easy given she chose to work in a place with no proper roads or electricity.\u00a0\nInitially, she had to put extra effort into working in a conducive environment, but now she loves every bit of her work. In her job, she focuses mostly on health issues, holds conducive talks with the local leaders, and tries to improve the lives of farmers.\u00a0\n\nGoma Kunwar \u2013 Entrepreneur\nGoma Kunwar\nThere was a time when many ridiculed Goma Kunwar for opening a vehicle workshop. Eleven years later, people tip their hats to Kunwar for persevering in an industry dominated by men. Yam Motor Parts, her workshop in Burtibang in Baglung, has been with her in both her good and bad times. It has given her strength during her dark days and shown her how great life can be during her good days.\u00a0\nThe workshop was set up in memory of her husband who died in Afghanistan and is one of few women who work in the trade. Some continue to ridicule her and ask her why she is in the business. But Goma does not care. All she cares about is carrying on this business which has given her a stable income.\u00a0\nWhile some ridicule her, others applaud her bravery and resilience. Through the workshop, she has also been providing employment opportunities to four mechanics and pays them well. In the trade for nearly a decade, Kunwar is now hailed as an expert.

That is slowly changing as the city has grown on her thanks to the many protests she\u2019s been part of in the city.\u00a0\nTumbapo is the general secretary of the Kirat Yakthum Chumlung. Ever since the government cut down public holidays dedicated to the indigenous people and after Province 1 was named Koshi, Tumbapo and others like her have been calling for changes as it undermined the struggles of their ancestors who have been native to the land for centuries.\u00a0\nTumbapo was seen at the forefront of this identity movement that went on in the province for a year. She has proved herself to be a rebel and is a great orator. Currently, she is deeply committed to ensuring the success of the identity movement that has gained momentum in rural areas. However, this is far from straightforward. While the movement commands a strong presence on the streets, its voice within the legislative chambers remains subdued.\u00a0\nNevertheless, there is optimism that even if the current parliament fails to adequately address the concerns of the movement, future parliamentary sessions may offer opportunities for progress. Despite the challenges, there remains hope that the movement\u2019s aspirations will eventually be acknowledged and addressed, potentially paving the way for meaningful change.\n\nAnuradha \u2013 Author\nAnuradha \nEverybody loves to listen to stories as they have the ability to transform people\u2019s lives.

She understood how important it was to fight for the rights of women like her and those underprivileged.\nThere have been several incidents that have deeply influenced her. The mistreatment of a Dalit ward member in Pokhara was one that filled her with anger. Another incident that frustrated her with society was the lynching of Narawaj BK and others.\nShe was raised by a mother who was a singer, and from an early age, Pariyar understood the importance of hard work. Despite her initial aspiration to become a nurse, fate had other plans for her. She fought for herself first and got citizenship solely through her mother\u2019s name. Now, she fights for injustice and discrimination against others like her.\n\nSushila Chaudhary- Lawyer/Activist\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdvocate and activist Sushila Chaudhary, who lost her brother and a sister during the Maoist insurgency, knows what war is and how it can tear families apart. This is why she has been actively involved in calling the government for changes in laws related to victims of the decade-long people\u2019s war.\u00a0\nFor the past 15 years, she has been an advocate for the victims of insurgency. Following Nepal\u2019s transition to democracy in 2006, while the country embraced democratic reforms, justice eluded the family members of war victims. Demanding change, Chaudhary and others have been organising protests, demanding accountability and justice from those in power. Many individuals who were involved in the insurgency remain missing, prompting ongoing calls for thorough investigations by their families.\n\nSrijana Sizzu \u2013 Traveller\n\nEven though Srijana Sizzu loves travelling through Nepal and the world, her heart is well set around the hills and valleys of Karnali Provice. A solo traveller and a content creator, Sizzu, through her videos, has vigorously promoted destinations in Karnali.\nThe places she visits are raw and untouched. These places are not found on a website or YouTube. Only a few know about it and Sizzu through her videos is out to show it to Nepal and the world. She says she has been to over 150 places but it is safe to say, her heart lies in Karnali.\nAs a woman solo traveller, she has encountered challenges and faced scrutiny regarding her life choices and decision to travel alone.

Currently, out of 263 district judges, there are only 18 female judges.\n\nJhuma Limbu \u2013 Musician\u00a0\n\nJhuma Limbu is a remarkable figure in Nepali music. She didn\u2019t just sing, she created her musical instrument called Dhela from a (khamer) tree during a lockdown, and other animal skins too. But Limbu didn\u2019t stick to the usual way of singing about women in songs. She wanted to change that and encouraged women to sing for themselves, expressing their thoughts and feelings.\nUsing the instruments, she created her own music and showed that music can be powerful and express a range of emotions, not just soft tunes. With her work, she is also contributing to preserving culture\u2013including different touches of communities like Sunuwar, Tharu, Deuda, and Karnali\u2013and innovating new tastes in music.

As a result, many of her demands were also addressed.\u00a0This experience inspired her to study law and later become an advocate. In the legal system, she encountered numerous injustices, particularly the plight of financially disadvantaged service seekers who could not afford legal representatives. \nWitnessing the challenges individuals face in accessing justice without the means to hire a lawyer, she decided to offer assistance to those in need. In her efforts, she developed her own policy: Khatiwada charges fees only to those who can afford to pay. For those who cannot, her services are provided voluntarily.\n\nTulsi Shahi \u2013 Staff nurse / Medical personnel\n\nTulsi Shahi is a 29-year-old nurse who dedicated her life to the people in the remote village of Pulu in Mugu. She started working there in 2019 in a local health post, which was in a bad state at that time.\u00a0\nThe road reaching Pulu was tough due to risky roads and bad weather. When she first got there, the villagers were not very aware of the importance of basic hygiene, and health checkups and, hence, did not visit the health centre. They would rather visit the local shamans in times of need.\nSo, Shahi faced the challenge starting from there\u2013and others being organising gatherings, giving advice or counselling, and even providing meals as a lure to get their attention. Now, Shahi is not just a health worker; the villagers call her an incarnation of God because of the love, service and care she has imparted.\nShahi, while working, does not just stop at her regular responsibilities. She also helped people understand things like contraception and women\u2019s health. Her efforts have reduced childbirth-related problems, home births and risks related to it, and encouraged people to stay healthy.\nShe faced many problems in her own life\u2013having a difficult childhood and also tackling the challenges of being a single mom to her son. The work and her story are as inspirational.\n\nSarita Sah \u2013 Actor\n\nSarita Sah\u2019s life revolves around acting. Growing up in Madhesh Provice, she remembers having to pay a certain fee to go watch films at her neighbour\u2019s house on a Saturday. But her love for acting grew deep when she became involved in radio skits.\nThis paved the way for her to venture into theatre, where she found herself standing in front of over 100 people at Shilpee Theatre. Acting in a play that shed light on gender-based violence, Sah realised the significant role such productions could play in society. This understanding motivated her to participate in productions that address issues of women\u2019s rights, discrimination, and citizenship.\nWith over a decade of experience in the film and acting industry, Sah is a multifaceted talent, involved in acting, writing, and directing. She has worked on feature films, short films, and advertisements, showcasing her versatility and skill.\nCurrently, through her foundation, Sah is raising awareness about socioeconomic, political, and gender issues using storytelling tools, techniques, and media platforms. Her commitment to addressing these pressing issues through her creative work demonstrates her passion for social change and advocacy.\n\nDr Sushila Maharjan \u2013 Researcher/Biochemist\n\nA decade ago, Sushila Maharjan went to South Korea to pursue a PhD in biochemistry. While studying and conducting research there, she realised that similar research opportunities could also be pursued in Nepal.\nAfter completing her PhD, she returned to Nepal and set up a research centre together with her husband. The Research Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology which was opened by Maharjan and eight other friends, has been researching bacteria ever since.\nShe believes chemistry is the core of all life and her career and has dedicated her life to researching it. Through the institute, she has researched around 200 bacteria found in Nepal\u2019s mountains, hills, and plains. Research which focused on identifying antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs also earned her and her team an international award. It was remarkable how the institute which started in a small room in Kathmandu managed to win an award in a few years.\nNow, Mahajan aims to do research according to Nepal\u2019s sociobiological and demographic needs. However, currently, Maharjan is involved in researching the study of artificial cells capable of functioning as human organs. This research aims to revive human organs that are unable to function properly. The method, known as tissue engineering, involves techniques similar to the maintenance of human organs. By advancing this technology, it may become possible to restore the function of non-working organs and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals in need.\n\nSharmila Kumari Ram \u2013 Local representative\u00a0\n\nIn the Madhesh province, there is a feeling of resentment among the citizens towards the people\u2019s representatives. But there is an exception and that is Sharmila Kumari Ram (34) because of her good work, trying to make life better for everyone. Working in Barahathawa municipality-10, in Sarlahi, she is the only Dalit ward chair there.\nEven though she has the conventional obligation at home as a daughter-in-law, she has also worked hard outside as a leader, always ready to help when they need it.\nAmong the local representatives, she has been perceived as the one who uses the money wisely for the ward, prioritising education, and health, and making the ward better with better physical infrastructures. During the epidemic, she also conducted a relief campaign for the poor families who were in the grip of starvation. She has given more and has even used her salary to teach underprivileged kids who can\u2019t afford it, distributing bags and stationeries to 800 children. Next, she plans to start teaching in English medium.\nSharmila Kumari Ram takes her father, who was politically active too, as the inspiration to do good for others. And even though he\u2019s not around anymore, she\u2019s carrying on his dream.\u00a0\nHowever, she believes that people in the community still face challenges in the social construct and the narrow mindset towards women, especially the Dalit community. She believes there is a lot to work on and is planning to run again as the ward president in the next election.\n\nSunita Chaudhary \u2013 Ecosystem services specialist\n\nSunita Chaudhary is the first female from the Tharu community to complete a PhD.

Similarly, she is also an ecosystem services specialist, at ICIMOD.\u00a0 She is a researcher, studying issues affecting indigenous communities and climate change in the Himalayan region of Nepal.\nOceans and islands are always on the agenda at climate and environmental conferences like COP. But the issues of the Himalayan region are not well. Chaudhary has been constantly raising her voice about it. She believes that Nepal has not been able to hold discussions about the climate issue in the country where the world\u2019s top officials participate.\u00a0\n\nLaxmi Ghimire- Province Assembly Member\n\nLaxmi Ghimire was just 16 years old when she had an unfortunate incident in Ramechhap.

Now, 30-year-old Ghimire is an Assembly member of the Bagmati Province.\nGhimire, who became a proportional member of parliament from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) in the election of November 4, 2022, has been participating meaningfully in the state assembly. She raised her voice in parliament to make the state assembly building disabled-friendly. As a result, a wheelchair-rolling structure was built for the disabled.\nGhimire, who first began her journey to the state assembly by creating a structure, expressed interest in the services and rights of the disabled on the bill to amend the Public Health Services Act, of 2018. Before that, she used to be a sportsperson who played sports like basketball, cricket and powerlifting. She even participated in the Powerlifting World Cup in 2018.\u00a0\nGhimire, who went through a difficult journey after becoming disabled, is still worried about the change in society\u2019s view of people with disabilities.

Despite limited formal education, she became a dedicated helper for those in need and was rejected by society. In 2012, she started a group called \u2018Awaz Nepal\u2019 to formally assist people of all ages, including women, kids, and elderly people, making sure they get justice and any legal help they might need as well.

    "235": "\n\nWhile working at the Physical Rehabilitation Centre of the National Disabled Fund under the Social Welfare Council, Sabita Upreti one day visited the squatter area near the Hanumante River in Bhaktapur. There, she witnessed an eight-year-old boy tied with a rope, covered in faeces and urine, near a heap of garbage in front of the settlement.\nShe was deeply saddened and teared up by the sight. She could not help but think to herself \u2013 this child also deserves to play and have fun like any other child. Upon inquiry, she got to know that the child had autism.\nDeeply bothered by the scene, she began contemplating the necessity of caring for such children. She scoured the valley in search of any establishments that were catering to their needs but found none.\nLater on a Saturday, accompanied by her siblings, she went to visit the boy. Alongside the child, they also encountered his parents. First and foremost, she pleaded for the child to be untied, but the parents remained hesitant. They feared that untying the rope might lead the child to flee and potentially harm others. However, she persisted and persuaded, leading the parents to reluctantly remove the rope.\u00a0\nBut the next scene left Upreti troubled even more. The boy dashed straight to the garbage heap, retrieved a discarded book page and aimlessly started flipping it around. Upreti had assumed that the child would dash towards the food and toys, she was holding, upon being freed. She was left stunned.\nUpon being freed, the boy\u2019s face radiated joy. He relished the newfound freedom to roam and promptly engaged in play.\nUpreti started thinking, \u201cI got the education and a good life. Here, people still have to understand what living means. I have to do something for them.\u201d Thus, with this determination, she started to work for children with autism.\nShe left her job the next day. One such fateful day in July 2009, where she found a child in a squatter area became the \u2018turning point\u2019 of her life. For 13 years, Sabita Upreti has dedicated her life to serving autistic children by establishing special schools and rehabilitation centres.\nFrom desire to destruction\n\n\n\nBorn in Baiteshwor rural municipality of Dolakha, Upreti\u2019s family believed that their daughter should be educated and empowered. So she got the opportunity to study. She passed her entrance exam in 2000 from Baiteshwor Secondary School with first division. Back in the day, clearing the entrance exam with first division from government schools was not a trivial matter.\nHer family decided to send her to Kathmandu for higher education. But it was difficult to gather the money for the expenses. Realising this, she started teaching at Saraswati Secondary School in Jorpati. After seven years of teaching, Sabita Upreti was appointed as Central Management Officer at the Physical Rehabilitation Centre.\nAfter the incident, she resigned from her job and joined social service, but she had nothing, neither money nor work experience, but the heart to work in the service of children with autism. While working in the field of disability, she learned a little about autism, but it was not enough to get involved in that field full-fledged.\nSo she did a lot of self-study and travelled to India to gather more information, even undergoing a six-month training programme. During this time, she learned that autism is a condition observed in children who experience incomplete brain development, despite having healthy and intact bodies. These children exhibit symptoms such as delayed speech, difficulties in communication, self-isolation, and challenges in social interaction.\nThis newfound understanding led her to recognise that therapy and cognitive engagement are essential components of treatment. Despite acquiring substantial knowledge, financial constraints remained a challenge. She ended up using her savings from her job for training.\nFilled with enthusiasm to open up an organisation, she returned to her village. Meanwhile, her parents were preparing for her. When she shared her plans with her parents, her father disapproved and even scolded her saying, \u201cThis is the time to build your own life, why burden yourself with the responsibility of others\u2019 children?\u201d\nHowever, her mother\u2019s unwavering support bolstered her confidence. Defiantly, she declared to her father, \u201cI have no intentions of marrying at this moment. Instead of saving for a future wedding, invest in my vision now.\u201d\nSabita Upreti walked out of her house with the Rs 500,000 her family had collected for wedding expenditures. On her birthday in 2010, she inaugurated the Special School for Disabled and Rehabilitation Center (SSDRC) in a rented residence in Kadaghari, Kathmandu, and provided shelter for two children.\nIt took her a year to get five children at the centre. While talking about her school intending to provide autistic children with treatment and education, some alleged her saying she is exploiting their offspring for financial gain. Some even let their dogs loose on her. She recounts, \u201cI still bear the scars from dog bites on my body.\u201d\nGradually, she got children with autism and set up the learning environment according to their preferences. Even though it was a minimal effort, the outcomes were undoubtedly for the good. The children began comprehending the conversations, demonstrating the ability to draw, and managing personal tasks, like other individuals without disabilities.\nWith the improvement in the condition of these children, Sabita no longer had to visit anyone\u2019s house. Parents started seeking her out with their children who had autism. In the second year, the number of children gradually increased, reaching 13.\nHowever, as the number increased, so did the challenges within the organisation. Parents expected children who hadn\u2019t spoken in 10 years to start speaking within a month of enrolling in school, which was not possible. Consequently, she intensified her efforts to explain autism to the parents. So, gradually, the parents also began to trust her words.\nNow, the organisation has expanded to three branches in Narephant, Gothatar, and Bhaktapur. Today, Sabita Upreti is providing special education and rehabilitation to 60 children and teenagers across these locations. So far, the organisation has served over 500 such children.\nIt all begins with the mindset\n\nThose with autism have trouble doing even the simplest and most common tasks such as dressing themselves, going to the toilet, and washing their hands afterwards. And parents don\u2019t try to teach them thinking they won\u2019t understand. \u201cFirstly, parents should acknowledge their child\u2019s condition and promptly seek medical and therapeutic assistance,\u201d she says.\nThe main objective of Sabita Upreti\u2019s organisation is to break this misconception and help the children to do such simple work to read and to rehabilitate them in society by teaching them such skills. \n\u201cThere has been a delay in raising public awareness about autism,\u201d she says.\nThe institution caters to children aged 3 to 7 until they reach the age of 13. They have the services for pickup from home at 9 am and drop-off at 4 pm. Meanwhile, throughout the day, the children receive therapy alongside various learning activities.\nSabita Upreti knows very well that in this time of scarcity and hustle and bustle, such children become a financial and mental burden for the family. And she is doing the work of turning this adversity of the family into a favourable one.\n\u201cIt takes patience to take care of children with autism,\u201d she says, \u201cThat\u2019s why I give special training to every teaching staff who joins SSDRC.\u201d\nSabita Upreti has today left an extraordinary impact on society through such simple works. She has been awarded the International Courageous Women Award-2023 by the Human Rights Council of India, the Janasewa Shree Padak (for social service) by the Government of Nepal, and the National Youth Talent Award (for social service and education) by the Ministry of Youth and Sports.\nShe has embraced motherhood for many children despite not giving birth, \u201cI feel as though these children are my own, and it brings me joy to serve them.\u201d\nHaving said that, the number of children with autism is increasing day by day. One person or organisation alone can no longer undertake the task of their education and rehabilitation. \u201cNow the state should take the lead in this endeavour,\u201d says Upreti.\n ",

It is not just a source of knowledge and guardian of culture but also a vibrant hub of community engagement and indicators of human development.\nIndeed, libraries are important sources of ancient, valuable, and rare documents preserved by our ancestors. They play a significant role in the documentary heritage of a nation.\nThe library\nLibraries also need to evolve with time. From ancient times to today\u2019s digital archives, libraries have adapted to serve diverse societies\u2019 needs. Their primary objective is to enhance the education system by providing information resources, services, and facilities to fulfil users\u2019 informational, research, educational, cultural, and recreational requirements.\nOn February 26, 2024, an educational programme on \u201cThe Future of World Library\u201d by G 30 K-Library and Naiel Newspaper was held at the National Library for Children and Adults, Seoul, South Korea. The goal of this programme was to share the education and library systems of South Korea and other nations around the world. Thirty international students, including one Nepali student, participated and shared their experiences regarding libraries in their home countries.\nThe major libraries in Nepal are the national library, academic library, public library, community library, school library, and special library. The library in Durbar School (1854) was Nepal\u2019s first school library and Tri-Chandra Campus (1918) was the first academic library. However, these libraries were offered only to elite royals for a long time.\nThe Nepal National Library (1957), managed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, was the first public library in Nepal. Tribhuvan University Central Library (1959) is the largest library in Nepal with more than 4 million collections.\nNowadays many libraries in Nepal have adopted digital services for users\u2019 ease, unlike a decade ago. Tribhuvan University Central Library has started providing open study rooms for 24 hours. \u00a0Desired books and materials can be searched and reserved from home through the library website. This saves the time and effort through the technical facility.\nSouth Korea\u2019s education quality\nPhoto by freestocks on Unsplash\nSouth Korea is one of the countries that have been working effortlessly to provide these facilities through libraries. The country offers these services to attract all age groups, from children to the elderly as the country is facing a low birth rate and a high elderly population problem.\nSouth Korea\u2019s average birthrate is one of the lowest in the world and has plunged to a record new low (0.65 per cent), raising the concern of extinction. The country has over 19 per cent of the elderly population, facing a human resource problem. Therefore, South Korea offers many Asian countries to live and work to fulfil human resources.\nNepal is one of the countries where South Korea allows an EPS system. In 2023 South Korea announced 15,448 job openings in manufacturing, and a staggering number of 143,812 young Nepali applied for the post.\nMany people are eager to apply for jobs in South Korea, showing continued high demand for employment opportunities due to good income, advanced infrastructure, and technology. Therefore, South Korea could be a good place to raise kids while working.\nThe country underwent a remarkable transformation in the past by implementing a focused programme to uplift education quality and technology. Central to this transformation was the establishment of well-equipped and efficiently managed public libraries. In 1945, South Korea had a literacy rate of 22 per cent and a per capita GDP of $94 in 1961. By 2024, its literacy rate soared to 99 per cent, and its GDP per capita exceeded $34,000.\nThe visit to the National Library for Children and Adults provided insights that libraries can be more than just books and study places. In today\u2019s era of science and technology, libraries have become a core place that provides convenient and equitable access to useful resources for local citizens and people all around the world.\nEducation systems are embracing digital innovation globally to meet the needs of students in the digital age. By integrating various technologies, they provide accessible and entertaining services, benefiting Nepali of all ages and advancing their participation in the global arena.\n ",
    "237": "\n\nIn the looming magnificence of Nepal\u2019s mountains and amidst its vibrant culture, lies an underlying issue that silently undercuts the potential of half of its people; girls\u2019 under-representation.\nIt is not just about numbers but unachieved dreams, wasted abilities and a vicious poverty cycle that keeps on going. Bringing more girls into classrooms across Nepal is difficult but also full of hope and anticipation for a better future.The stories of Nepali girls may differ. But many have similar stories like fetching water in the mornings instead of reading books, long distances they are supposed to walk to school which are deemed too far as well as household chores that are too heavily burdening them with less time for their homework.\nEducation for girls\nGirls ride their bicycles at a rally at Gauriganj on March 8, 2022. Photo: Greenway\nEducation for these girls remains an illusion because it has to come second after taking care of immediate family needs while upholding cultural norms that assign specific duties and roles.These barriers to their education are both complicated and deeply ingrained in themselves. In rural Nepal where the majority of the population resides, gendered traditional roles often restrict girls. What worsens this problem even further is economic hardship wherein families must make heart-rending choices \u2013 whether or not they can afford to educate their boys over their daughters.\nYet, amidst these challenges, there lies a pathway to change. It begins with the heart of the community \u2013 understanding and reshaping the cultural narratives that have long-defined gender roles.\nEngaging community leaders, parents, and local organisations in dialogue about the value of educating girls can spark a cultural shift, transforming outdated norms into a collective support system for girls\u2019 education.\nPolicy reform plays a crucial role in this transformation. The Nepali government has indeed made strides with initiatives aimed at making education more accessible. Yet, there\u2019s a need for policies that specifically target the barriers preventing girls from reaching the classroom.\nSolutions such as scholarships for girls, building schools within closer proximity to remote villages, and providing essential school supplies can help alleviate the economic and physical burdens that families face.\nNeed for tailored educational programmes\nFile: The number of girls at schools in Madhesh is increasing.\nInnovative educational programmes tailored to the needs of Nepali girls offer another beacon of hope. Flexible schooling hours, gender-sensitive curricula, and teacher training on gender issues could create an educational environment where girls are not just present but are thriving. These adjustments acknowledge the unique challenges girls face and offer practical solutions that make education a viable part of their lives.\nThe impact of these efforts extends far beyond individual lives. Educating girls can transform economies, reduce poverty, and promote health and well-being across communities. It\u2019s a ripple effect that starts with a single girl sitting in a classroom, her mind alight with knowledge and the promise of a future she will shape.\nIndeed, there are glimmers of this transformation across Nepal. In pockets of the country, targeted interventions have led to remarkable increases in girls\u2019 school enrollment. These success stories are a testament to what is possible when communities, governments, and organisations come together with a shared vision.\nBut the work is far from over. The dream of educating every girl in Nepal is ambitious, yet it is within reach. It requires a continued commitment from all sectors of society\u2014a collective effort that champions the cause of girls\u2019 education at every turn.\nAs we move forward, let\u2019s envision Nepal where every girl can walk through the doors of a school, not just as a student, but as a future leader, innovator, and change-maker. It\u2019s a journey that requires persistence, collaboration, and heart. But it\u2019s a journey that will light the way for generations to come, illuminating a path where every girl can follow her dreams, empowered by the transformative power of education.\n ",

    "240": "\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\nNepal Rastra Bank publishes updated details of various economic indicators every month which shows the state of the country\u2019s economy.\nBased on the data released by the apex bank on Sunday, Onlinekhabar has attempted to present a snapshot of the economy in 10 graphs.\n\nIn the fiscal years 2021/22 and 2022/23, inflation which was 8 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively, dropped to 5 per cent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe contraction in the country\u2019s export trade, which commenced in the last fiscal year 2022/23, persists. However, there has been a slight decrease in the rate of contraction\n\nThe trend of declining business in exports is mirrored in imports as well. Even in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, imports have decreased by 2.3 per cent.\n\nRemittances have surged while imports and exports have contracted. Compared to mid-January last year, remittances have increased by 22 per cent in the same period this year.\n\nThe decline in imports and the rise in remittances have affected the balance of payments. In the first seven months of this year, the balance of payments has turned positive by Rs 298 billion.\n\nForeign exchange reserves are also on a continuous rise. As of mid-January, Nepal\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stand at USD 13.89 billion, which can cover 12.3 months of goods and services.\n\nHowever, foreign investment remains disappointing. Until the fiscal year 2021/22, FDI over Rs 19 billion were received annually. However, only Rs 7.77 billion were received in the last fiscal year, and a mere Rs 5.19 billion were received in the first seven months of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe amount of money Nepalis spend abroad for travel and education has increased significantly. By mid-February 2023, Rs 69.89 billion were spent under this category, whereas this year it has reached Rs 105 billion during the same period.\n\nIn the current financial year, bank interest rates have been continuously decreasing. In mid-January, the average weighted interest rate of commercial banks\u2019 loans dropped to 11.08 per cent. This is lower than the pre-Covid levels of 2018/19.\n\nDespite the decrease in interest rates, credit expansion remains sluggish. By mid-Februday, credit to the private sector had only expanded by 5.4 per cent. During the Covid period, it had increased by 26 per cent.\n "
